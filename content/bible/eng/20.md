      <li>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</li>
      <li>To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</li>
      <li>To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;</li>
      <li>To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</li>
      <li>A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:</li>
      <li>To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</li>
      <li>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.</li>
      <li>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</li>
      <li>For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</li>
      <li>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</li>
      <li>If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:</li>
      <li>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</li>
      <li>We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</li>
      <li>Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</li>
      <li>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</li>
      <li>For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</li>
      <li>Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</li>
      <li>And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.</li>
      <li>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</li>
      <li>Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</li>
      <li>She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,</li>
      <li>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</li>
      <li>Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</li>
      <li>Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</li>
      <li>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</li>
      <li>I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</li>
      <li>When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.</li>
      <li>Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:</li>
      <li>For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</li>
      <li>They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</li>
      <li>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</li>
      <li>For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</li>
      <li>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.</li>

      <li>My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</li>
      <li>So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</li>
      <li>Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</li>
      <li>If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</li>
      <li>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</li>
      <li>For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</li>
      <li>He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</li>
      <li>He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</li>
      <li>Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</li>
      <li>When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</li>
      <li>Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</li>
      <li>To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</li>
      <li>Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</li>
      <li>Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</li>
      <li>Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</li>
      <li>To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</li>
      <li>Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</li>
      <li>For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</li>
      <li>None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</li>
      <li>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</li>
      <li>For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</li>
      <li>But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</li>

      <li>My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:</li>
      <li>For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</li>
      <li>Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:</li>
      <li>So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</li>
      <li>Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</li>
      <li>In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</li>
      <li>Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</li>
      <li>It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</li>
      <li>Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:</li>
      <li>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</li>
      <li>My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</li>
      <li>For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</li>
      <li>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</li>
      <li>For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</li>
      <li>She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.</li>
      <li>Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.</li>
      <li>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</li>
      <li>The is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</li>
      <li>The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</li>
      <li>By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</li>
      <li>My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</li>
      <li>So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</li>
      <li>Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</li>
      <li>When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</li>
      <li>Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</li>
      <li>For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.</li>
      <li>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</li>
      <li>Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</li>
      <li>Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</li>
      <li>Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.</li>
      <li>Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</li>
      <li>For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</li>
      <li>The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.</li>
      <li>Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.</li>
      <li>The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</li>

      <li>Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</li>
      <li>For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</li>
      <li>For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</li>
      <li>He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</li>
      <li>Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</li>
      <li>Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</li>
      <li>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</li>
      <li>Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</li>
      <li>She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</li>
      <li>Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</li>
      <li>I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</li>
      <li>When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</li>
      <li>Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</li>
      <li>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</li>
      <li>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</li>
      <li>For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</li>
      <li>For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</li>
      <li>But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</li>
      <li>The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</li>
      <li>My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</li>
      <li>Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</li>
      <li>For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</li>
      <li>Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</li>
      <li>Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</li>
      <li>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</li>
      <li>Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</li>
      <li>Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</li>
      <li>That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</li>
      <li>For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</li>
      <li>But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</li>
      <li>Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</li>
      <li>Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</li>
      <li>Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</li>
      <li>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</li>
      <li>Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</li>
      <li>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</li>
      <li>And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</li>
      <li>And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</li>
      <li>And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</li>
      <li>I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</li>
      <li>Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</li>
      <li>Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</li>
      <li>Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</li>
      <li>Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</li>
      <li>Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</li>
      <li>And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</li>
      <li>For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</li>
      <li>His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</li>
      <li>He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</li>
      <li>Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</li>
      <li>Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</li>
      <li>Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</li>
      <li>Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</li>
      <li>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</li>
      <li>Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</li>
      <li>Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</li>
      <li>How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</li>
      <li>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</li>
      <li>So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</li>
      <li>A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</li>
      <li>He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</li>
      <li>Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</li>
      <li>Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</li>
      <li>These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:</li>
      <li>A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</li>
      <li>An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</li>
      <li>A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</li>
      <li>My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</li>
      <li>Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.</li>
      <li>When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</li>
      <li>For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</li>
      <li>To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</li>
      <li>Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</li>
      <li>For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</li>
      <li>Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</li>
      <li>Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</li>
      <li>So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</li>
      <li>Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</li>
      <li>But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</li>
      <li>But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</li>
      <li>A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</li>
      <li>For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</li>
      <li>He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

    <ol>
      <li>My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</li>
      <li>Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</li>
      <li>Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</li>
      <li>Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</li>
      <li>That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</li>
      <li>For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</li>
      <li>And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</li>
      <li>Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</li>
      <li>In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</li>
      <li>And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</li>
      <li>(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</li>
      <li>Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</li>
      <li>So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</li>
      <li>I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</li>
      <li>Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</li>
      <li>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</li>
      <li>I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</li>
      <li>For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</li>
      <li>He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</li>
      <li>With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</li>
      <li>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</li>
      <li>Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</li>
      <li>Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</li>
      <li>Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</li>
      <li>For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</li>
      <li>Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</li>
    </ol>

      <li>Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</li>
      <li>She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</li>
      <li>She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</li>
      <li>Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</li>
      <li>O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</li>
      <li>Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</li>
      <li>For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</li>
      <li>All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.</li>
      <li>They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</li>
      <li>Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</li>
      <li>For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</li>
      <li>I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</li>
      <li>The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</li>
      <li>Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</li>
      <li>By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</li>
      <li>By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</li>
      <li>I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</li>
      <li>Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</li>
      <li>My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</li>
      <li>I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</li>
      <li>That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</li>
      <li>The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</li>
      <li>I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</li>
      <li>When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</li>
      <li>Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</li>
      <li>While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</li>
      <li>When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</li>
      <li>When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</li>
      <li>When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</li>
      <li>Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</li>
      <li>Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</li>
      <li>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</li>
      <li>Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</li>
      <li>Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</li>
      <li>For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</li>
      <li>But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</li>

      <li>Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</li>
      <li>She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</li>
      <li>She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</li>
      <li>Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</li>
      <li>Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</li>
      <li>Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</li>
      <li>He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</li>
      <li>Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</li>
      <li>Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</li>
      <li>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</li>
      <li>For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</li>
      <li>If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</li>
      <li>A foolish woman is clamourous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</li>
      <li>For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</li>
      <li>To call passengers who go right on their ways:</li>
      <li>Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</li>
      <li>Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</li>
      <li>But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.</li>
      <li>A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</li>
      <li>When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</li>
      <li>The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</li>
      <li>It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</li>
      <li>A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</li>
      <li>A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</li>
      <li>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</li>
      <li>He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</li>
      <li>The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</li>
      <li>The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</li>
      <li>Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</li>
      <li>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</li>
      <li>The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</li>
      <li>The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</li>
      <li>A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</li>
      <li>He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</li>
      <li>The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</li>
      <li>A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</li>
      <li>A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</li>
      <li>Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</li>
      <li>Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</li>
      <li>The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</li>
      <li>A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</li>

      <li>Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</li>
      <li>Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</li>
      <li>The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</li>
      <li>Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</li>
      <li>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.</li>
      <li>Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</li>
      <li>All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</li>
      <li>He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</li>
      <li>A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.</li>
      <li>Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</li>
      <li>The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</li>
      <li>The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.</li>
      <li>A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</li>
      <li>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the LORD.</li>
      <li>Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</li>
      <li>He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.</li>
      <li>He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</li>
      <li>Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</li>
      <li>A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.</li>
      <li>Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</li>
      <li>There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</li>
      <li>The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.</li>
      <li>The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</li>
      <li>A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</li>
      <li>Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</li>
      <li>He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</li>
      <li>Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.</li>
      <li>An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</li>
      <li>Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</li>

      <li>Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</li>
      <li>The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.</li>
      <li>It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</li>
      <li>The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</li>
      <li>Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</li>
      <li>Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</li>
      <li>The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.</li>
      <li>A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</li>
      <li>Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</li>
      <li>Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.</li>
      <li>Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</li>
      <li>The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</li>
      <li>Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</li>
      <li>It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</li>
      <li>There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</li>
      <li>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</li>
      <li>Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</li>
      <li>Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</li>
      <li>He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</li>
      <li>Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</li>
      <li>An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</li>
      <li>Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</li>
      <li>Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.</li>
      <li>Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</li>
      <li>It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.</li>
      <li>A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</li>
      <li>The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</li>
      <li>Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</li>
      <li>The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.</li>
      <li>The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.</li>

      <li>The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.</li>
      <li>Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</li>
      <li>To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</li>
      <li>An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.</li>
      <li>The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.</li>
      <li>The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</li>
      <li>The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</li>
      <li>The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.</li>
      <li>It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</li>
      <li>The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</li>
      <li>When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</li>
      <li>The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.</li>
      <li>Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</li>
      <li>A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</li>
      <li>It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</li>
      <li>The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</li>
      <li>He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</li>
      <li>The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</li>
      <li>It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</li>
      <li>There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</li>
      <li>He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</li>
      <li>A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</li>
      <li>Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</li>
      <li>Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</li>
      <li>The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</li>
      <li>He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</li>
      <li>The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</li>
      <li>A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</li>
      <li>A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.</li>

      <li>By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.</li>

      <li>Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.</li>

      <li>Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</li>
      <li>For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.</li>
      <li>Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:</li>
      <li>Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</li>
      <li>Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.</li>

      <li>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</li>
      <li>Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</li>

      <li>The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</li>

      <li>My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</li>

      <li>Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</li>
      <li>For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</li>
      <li>Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth:</li>

      <li>My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:</li>

      <li>And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</li>
      <li>Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction.</li>
      <li>Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</li>

      <li>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</li>
      <li>The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</li>
      <li>Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</li>
      <li>Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</li>
      <li>Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</li>
      <li>For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</li>
      <li>Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</li>
      <li>Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</li>
      <li>Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</li>
      <li>A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</li>
      <li>As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</li>

      <li>Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</li>
      <li>By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</li>
      <li>Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</li>
      <li>Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</li>
      <li>A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</li>
      <li>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</li>

      <li>If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</li>

      <li>The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</li>
      <li>It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</li>

      <li>A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</li>
      <li>Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</li>
      <li>Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</li>
      <li>He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</li>
      <li>The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</li>
      <li>As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</li>
      <li>As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</li>
      <li>The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</li>
      <li>As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.</li>
      <li>Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</li>
      <li>The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</li>
      <li>As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</li>
      <li>The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</li>
      <li>The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</li>
      <li>He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</li>
      <li>As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</li>
      <li>So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</li>
      <li>Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</li>
      <li>As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.</li>
      <li>The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</li>
      <li>Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.</li>
      <li>He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</li>
      <li>When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.</li>
      <li>Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.</li>
      <li>Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</li>
      <li>A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</li>

      <li>Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</li>
      <li>Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</li>
      <li>A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.</li>
      <li>Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?</li>
      <li>Open rebuke is better than secret love.</li>
      <li>Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</li>
      <li>The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</li>
      <li>As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</li>
      <li>Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</li>
      <li>Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</li>
      <li>My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</li>
      <li>A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</li>
      <li>Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</li>
      <li>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</li>
      <li>A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</li>
      <li>Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</li>
      <li>Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</li>
      <li>Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</li>
      <li>As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.</li>
      <li>Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</li>
      <li>As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.</li>
      <li>Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</li>
      <li>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.</li>
      <li>For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?</li>
      <li>The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</li>
      <li>The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</li>
      <li>And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.</li>

      <li>The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</li>
      <li>For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</li>
      <li>A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</li>
      <li>They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</li>
      <li>Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</li>
      <li>Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</li>
      <li>Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.</li>
      <li>He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</li>
      <li>He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</li>
      <li>Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.</li>
      <li>The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</li>
      <li>When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</li>
      <li>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</li>
      <li>Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</li>
      <li>As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</li>
      <li>The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</li>
      <li>A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</li>
      <li>Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</li>
      <li>He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</li>
      <li>A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</li>
      <li>To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.</li>
      <li>He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</li>
      <li>He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</li>
      <li>Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</li>
      <li>He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</li>
      <li>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</li>
      <li>He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</li>

      <li>He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</li>
      <li>When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</li>
      <li>Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.</li>
      <li>The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</li>
      <li>A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</li>
      <li>In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</li>
      <li>The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.</li>
      <li>Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.</li>
      <li>If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.</li>
      <li>The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</li>
      <li>A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.</li>
      <li>If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</li>
      <li>The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</li>
      <li>The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</li>
      <li>The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.</li>
      <li>When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</li>
      <li>Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</li>
      <li>Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.</li>
      <li>A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</li>
      <li>Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.</li>
      <li>He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.</li>
      <li>An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</li>
      <li>A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</li>
      <li>Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.</li>
      <li>The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</li>
      <li>Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.</li>
      <li>An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</li>

      <li>The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</li>
      <li>Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</li>
      <li>I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</li>
      <li>Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</li>
      <li>Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</li>
      <li>Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</li>
      <li>Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:</li>
      <li>Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</li>
      <li>Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</li>
      <li>Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</li>
      <li>There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</li>
      <li>There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</li>
      <li>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</li>
      <li>There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</li>
      <li>The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</li>
      <li>The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</li>
      <li>The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</li>
      <li>There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</li>
      <li>The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</li>
      <li>Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</li>
      <li>For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</li>
      <li>For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</li>
      <li>For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</li>
      <li>There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</li>
      <li>The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</li>
      <li>The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</li>
      <li>The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</li>
      <li>The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</li>
      <li>There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</li>
      <li>A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</li>
      <li>A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</li>
      <li>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</li>
      <li>Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</li>

      <li>What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</li>
      <li>Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</li>
      <li>It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</li>
      <li>Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</li>
      <li>Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</li>
      <li>Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</li>
      <li>Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</li>
      <li>Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</li>
      <li>Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</li>
      <li>The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</li>
      <li>She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</li>
      <li>She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</li>
      <li>She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</li>
      <li>She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</li>
      <li>She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</li>
      <li>She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</li>
      <li>She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.</li>
      <li>She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</li>
      <li>She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</li>
      <li>She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</li>
      <li>She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</li>
      <li>Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</li>
      <li>She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</li>
      <li>Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</li>
      <li>She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</li>
      <li>She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</li>
      <li>Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</li>
      <li>Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</li>
      <li>Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</li>
      <li>Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</li>
