<h1>Paradise Lost</h1>
<h2>Book 1</h2>

Of Man's first disobedience, and the fruit<br/>
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste<br/>
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man<br/>
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br/>
Sing, Heav’nly Muse, that, on the secret top<br/>
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire<br/>
That Shepherd who first taught the chosen seed<br/>
In the beginning how the heavens and earth<br/>
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill<br/>
Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flowed<br/>
Fast by the oracle of God; I thence<br/>
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous song,<br/>
That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>
Above the Aonian mount, while it pursues<br/>
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.<br/>
And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>
Before all temples th’ upright heart and pure,<br/>
Instruct me, for Thou knowst; Thou from the first<br/>
Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,<br/>
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss,<br/>
And mad’st it pregnant: what in me is dark<br/>
Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>
That, to the highth of this great argument,<br/>
I may assert Eternal Providence,<br/>
And justify the ways of God to men.

Say first, for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,<br/>
Nor the deep tract of Hell, say first what cause<br/>
Mov’d our Grand Parents, in that happy state,<br/>
Favour’d of Heaven so highly, to fall off<br/>
From their Creator, and transgress his will<br/>
For one restraint, lords of the World besides.<br/>
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?<br/>
Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was whose guile,<br/>
Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived<br/>
The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride<br/>
Had cast him out from Heaven, with all his host<br/>
Of rebel Angels, by whose aid, aspiring<br/>
To set himself in glory above his peers,<br/>
He trusted to have equalled the Most High,<br/>
If he oppos’d, and, with ambitious aim<br/>
Against the throne and monarchy of God,<br/>
Raised impious war in Heav’n and battle proud,<br/>
With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power<br/>
Hurled headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal sky,<br/>
With hideous ruin and combustion, down<br/>
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>
In adamantine chains and penal fire,<br/>
Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms.<br/>
Nine times the space that measures Day and Night<br/>
To mortal men, he, with his horrid crew,<br/>
Lay vanquished, rowling in the fiery Gulf,<br/>
Confounded, though immortal. But his doom<br/>
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>
Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes,<br/>
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,<br/>
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.<br/>
At once, as far as Angel's ken, he views<br/>
The dismal situation waste and wild.<br/>
A dungeon horrible, on all sides round,<br/>
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames<br/>
No light; but rather darkness visible<br/>
Served only to discover sights of woe,<br/>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>
That comes to all, but torture without end<br/>
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed<br/>
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed.<br/>
Such place Eternal Justice had prepared<br/>
For those rebellious; here their prison ordained<br/>
In utter darkness, and their portion set,<br/>
As far removed from God and light of Heaven<br/>
As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.<br/>
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>
There the companions of his fall, o’erwhelmed<br/>
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>
He soon discerns; and, weltering by his side,<br/>
One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>
Long after known in Palestine, and named<br/>
Beelzebub. To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,<br/>
And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words<br/>
Breaking the horrid silence, thus began.

"If thou beest he; but Oh how fallen! how changed<br/>
From him, who, in the happy realms of light,<br/>
Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine<br/>
Myriads, though bright-if he whom mutual league,<br/>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope<br/>
And hazard in the glorious enterprise,<br/>
Joined with me once, now misery hath joined<br/>
In equal ruin; into what pit thou seest<br/>
From what highth fallen: so much the stronger proved<br/>
He with his thunder: and till then who knew<br/>
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those,<br/>
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage<br/>
Can else inflict, do I repent, or change,<br/>
Though changed in outward lustre, that fixed mind,<br/>
And high disdain from sense of injur’d merit,<br/>
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend,<br/>
And to the fierce contention brought along<br/>
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d,<br/>
That durst dislike his reign, and, me preferring,<br/>
His utmost power with adverse power opposed<br/>
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven,<br/>
And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?<br/>
All is not lost-the unconquerable will,<br/>
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>
And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>
And what is else not to be overcome.<br/>
That glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace<br/>
With suppliant knee, and deify his power<br/>
Who, from the terror of this arm, so late<br/>
Doubted his empire-that were low indeed;<br/>
That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>
This downfall; since, by fate, the strength of Gods,<br/>
And this empyreal substance, cannot fail;<br/>
Since, through experience of this great event,<br/>
In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,<br/>
We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>
To wage by force or guile eternal war,<br/>
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe,<br/>
Who now triumphs, and in the excess of joy<br/>
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven."

So spake the apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>
Vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair;<br/>
And him thus answered soon his bold Compeer; -

"O Prince, O Chief of many throned Powers<br/>
That led the embattled Seraphim to war<br/>
Under thy conduct, and, in dreadful deeds<br/>
Fearless, endangered Heaven's perpetual King,<br/>
And put to proof his high supremacy,<br/>
Whether upheld by strength, or chance, or fate!<br/>
Too well I see and rue the dire event<br/>
That, with sad overthrow and foul defeat,<br/>
Hath lost us Heaven, and all this mighty host<br/>
In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>
As far as Gods and Heavenly Essences<br/>
Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>
Though all our glory extinct, and happy state<br/>
Here swallowed up in endless misery.<br/>
But what if He our Conqueror (whom I now<br/>
Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br/>
Than such could have o'erpowered such force as ours)<br/>
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire,<br/>
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>
Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>
By right of war, whate'er his business be,<br/>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire,<br/>
Or do errands in the gloomy Deep?<br/>
What can it then avail though yet we feel<br/>
Strength undiminished, or eternal being<br/>
To undergo eternal punishment?"

Whereto with speedy words the Arch-Fiend replied:—<br/>
"Fallen Cherub, to be weak is miserable,<br/>
Doing or suffering: but of this be sure—<br/>
To do aught good never will be our task,<br/>
But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>
As being the contrary to His high will<br/>
Whom we resist. If then His providence<br/>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>
Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>
And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps<br/>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>
His inmost counsels from their destined aim.<br/>
But see! the angry Victor hath recalled<br/>
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>
Back to the gates of Heaven: the sulphurous hail,<br/>
Shot after us in storm, o'erblown hath laid<br/>
The fiery surge that from the precipice<br/>
Of Heaven received us falling; and the thunder,<br/>
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>
Let us not slip the occasion, whether scorn<br/>
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>
Seest thou yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,<br/>
The seat of desolation, void of light,<br/>
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend<br/>
From off the tossing of these fiery waves;<br/>
There rest, if any rest can harbour there;<br/>
And, re-assembling our afflicted powers,<br/>
Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>
How overcome this dire calamity,<br/>
What reinforcement we may gain from hope,<br/>
If not what resolution from despair."

Thus Satan, talking to his nearest Mate,<br/>
With head uplift above the wave, and eyes<br/>
That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides<br/>
Prone on the flood, extended long and large,<br/>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>
As whom the fables name of monstrous size,<br/>
Titanian or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,<br/>
Briareos or Typhon, whom the den<br/>
By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast<br/>
Leviathan, which God of all his works<br/>
Created hugest that swim the ocean-stream.<br/>
Him, haply slumbering on the Norway foam,<br/>
The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,<br/>
Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,<br/>
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind,<br/>
Moors by his side under the lee, while night<br/>
Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.<br/>
So stretched out huge in length the Arch-Fiend lay,<br/>
Chained on the burning lake; nor ever thence<br/>
Had risen, or heaved his head, but that the will<br/>
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>
Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>
That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>
Evil to others, and enraged might see<br/>
How all his malice served but to bring forth<br/>
Infinite goodness, grace, and mercy, shewn<br/>
On Man by him seduced, but on himself<br/>
Treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance poured.

Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool<br/>
His mighty stature; on each hand the flames<br/>
Driven backward slope their pointing spires, and, rowled<br/>
In billows, leave i' the midst a horrid vale.<br/>
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight<br/>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky air,<br/>
That felt unusual weight; till on dry land<br/>
He lights-if it were land that ever burned<br/>
With solid, as the lake with liquid fire,<br/>
And such appeared in hue as when the force<br/>
Of subterranean wind transports a hill<br/>
Torn from Pelorus, or the shattered side<br/>
Of thundering Aetna, whose combustible<br/>
And fuelled entrails, thence conceiving fire,<br/>
Sublimed with mineral fury, aid the winds,<br/>
And leave a singed bottom all involved<br/>
With stench and smoke. Such resting found the sole<br/>
Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate;<br/>
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood<br/>
As gods, and by their own recovered strength,<br/>
Not by the sufferance of supernal power.

"Is this the region, this the soil, the clime,"<br/>
Said then the lost Archangel, "this the seat<br/>
That we must change for Heaven?-this mournful gloom<br/>
For that celestial light? Be it so, since He<br/>
Who now is sovran can dispose and bid<br/>
What shall be right: fardest from Him is best,<br/>
Whom reason hath equalled, force hath made supreme<br/>
Above his equals. Farewell, happy fields,<br/>
Where joy forever dwells! Hail, horrors! hail,<br/>
Infernal World! and thou, profoundest Hell,<br/>
Receive thy new possessor-one who brings<br/>
A mind not to be changed by place or time.<br/>
The mind is its own place, and in itself<br/>
Can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.<br/>
What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>
And what I should be, all but less than he<br/>
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least<br/>
We shall be free; the Almighty hath not built<br/>
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>
Here we may reign secure; and, in my choice,<br/>
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:<br/>
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.<br/>
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>
The associates and co-partners of our loss,<br/>
Lie thus astonished on the oblivious pool,<br/>
And call them not to share with us their part<br/>
In this unhappy mansion, or once more<br/>
With rallied arms to try what may be yet<br/>
Regained in Heaven, or what more lost in Hell?"

So Satan spake; and him Beelzebub<br/>
Thus answered:—"Leader of those armies bright<br/>
Which, but the Omnipotent, none could have foiled!<br/>
If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge<br/>
Of hope in fears and dangers-heard so oft<br/>
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge<br/>
Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults<br/>
Their surest signal-they will soon resume<br/>
New courage and revive, though now they lie<br/>
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,<br/>
As we erewhile, astounded and amazed;<br/>
No wonder, fallen such a pernicious highth!"

He scarce had ceased when the superior Fiend<br/>
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield,<br/>
Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,<br/>
Behind him cast. The broad circumference<br/>
Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb<br/>
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views<br/>
At evening, from the top of Fesole,<br/>
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,<br/>
Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.<br/>
His spear-to equal which the tallest pine<br/>
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast<br/>
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand—<br/>
He walked with, to support uneasy steps<br/>
Over the burning marle, not like those steps<br/>
On Heaven's azure; and the torrid clime<br/>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.<br/>
Nathless he so endured, till on the beach<br/>
Of that inflamed sea he stood, and called<br/>
His legions-Angel Forms, who lay entranced<br/>
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks<br/>
In Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades<br/>
High over-arched imbower; or scattered sedge<br/>
Afloat, when with fierce winds Orion armed<br/>
Hath vexed the Red-Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew<br/>
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,<br/>
While with perfidious hatred they pursued<br/>
The sojourners of Goshen, who beheld<br/>
From the safe shore their floating carcases

And broken chariot-wheels. So thick bestrown,<br/>
Abject and lost, lay these, covering the flood,<br/>
Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>
He called so loud that all the hollow deep<br/>
Of Hell resounded:—"Princes, Potentates,<br/>
Warriors, the Flower of Heaven-once yours; now lost,<br/>
If such astonishment as this can seize<br/>
Eternal Spirits! Or have ye chosen this place<br/>
After the toil of battle to repose<br/>
Your wearied virtue, for the ease you find<br/>
To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?<br/>
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>
To adore the Conqueror, who now beholds<br/>
Cherub and Seraph rowling in the flood<br/>
With scattered arms and ensigns, till anon<br/>
His swift pursuers from Heaven-gates discern<br/>
The advantage, and, descending tread us down<br/>
Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts<br/>
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?—<br/>
Awake, arise, or be for ever fallen!"

They heard, and were abashed, and up they sprung<br/>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch,<br/>
On duty sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight<br/>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>
Yet to their General's voice they soon obeyed<br/>
Innumerable. As when the potent rod<br/>
Of Amram's son, in Egypt's evil day,<br/>
Waved round the coast, up-called a pitchy cloud<br/>
Of locusts, warping on the eastern wind,<br/>
That o'er the realm of impious Pharaoh hung<br/>
Like Night, and darkened all the land of Nile;<br/>
So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell,<br/>
'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding fires;<br/>
Till, as a signal given, the uplifted spear<br/>
Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>
Their course, in even balance down they light

On the firm brimstone, and fill the plain:<br/>
A multitude like which the populous North<br/>
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass<br/>
Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous sons<br/>
Came like a deluge on the South, and spread<br/>
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.<br/>
Forthwith, from every squadron and each band,<br/>
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood<br/>
Their great Commander-godlike Shapes, and Forms<br/>
Excelling human; princely Dignities;<br/>
And powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,<br/>
Though of their names in Heavenly records now<br/>
Be no memorial, blotted out and rased<br/>
By their rebellion from the Books of Life.<br/>
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve<br/>
Got them new names, till, wondering o'er the earth,<br/>
Through God's high sufferance for the trial of man,<br/>
By falsities and lies the greatest part<br/>
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>
God their Creator, and the invisible<br/>
Glory of Him that made them to transform<br/>
Oft to the image of a brute, adorned<br/>
With gay religions full of pomp and gold,<br/>
And devils to adore for deities:<br/>
Then were they known to men by various names,<br/>
And various idols through the heathen world.

Say, Muse, their names then known, who first, who last,<br/>
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch,<br/>
At their great Emperor's call, as next in worth<br/>
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof.

The chief were those who, from the pit of Hell<br/>
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth, durst fix<br/>
Their seats, long after, next the seat of God,<br/>
Their altars by His altar, gods adored<br/>
Among the nations round, and durst abide<br/>
Jehovah thundering out of Sion, throned<br/>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often placed<br/>
Within His sanctuary itself their shrines,<br/>
Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned,<br/>
And with their darkness durst affront His light.<br/>
First, Moloch, horrid King, besmeared with blood<br/>
Of human sacrifice, and parents' tears;<br/>
Though, for the noise of drums and timbrels loud,<br/>
Their children's cries unheard that passed through fire<br/>
To his grim idol. Him the Ammonite<br/>
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain,<br/>
In Argob and in Basan, to the stream<br/>
Of utmost Arnon. Nor content with such<br/>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>
Of Solomon he led by fraud to build<br/>
His temple right against the temple of God<br/>
On that opprobrious hill, and made his grove<br/>
The pleasant valley of Hinnom, Tophet thence<br/>
And black Gehenna called, the type of Hell.<br/>
Next Chemos, the obscene dread of Moab's sons,<br/>
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild<br/>
Of southmost Abarim; in Hesebon<br/>
And Horonaim, Seon's realm, beyond<br/>
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines,<br/>
And Eleale to the Asphaltick Pool:<br/>
Peor his other name, when he enticed<br/>
Israel in Sittim, on their march from Nile,<br/>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged<br/>
Even to that hill of scandal, by the grove<br/>
Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate,<br/>
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell.<br/>
With these came they who, from the bordering flood<br/>
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts<br/>
Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names<br/>
Of Baalim and Ashtaroth-those male,<br/>
These feminine. For Spirits, when they please,<br/>
Can either sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>
And uncompounded is their essence pure,<br/>
Not tied or manacled with joint or limb,<br/>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>
Like cumbrous flesh; but, in what shape they choose,<br/>
Dilated or condensed, bright or obscure,<br/>
Can execute their aery purposes,<br/>
And works of love or enmity fulfil.<br/>
For those the race of Israel oft forsook<br/>
Their Living Strength, and unfrequented left<br/>
His righteous altar, bowing lowly down<br/>
To bestial gods; for which their heads, as low<br/>
Bowed down in battle, sunk before the spear<br/>
Of despicable foes. With these in troop<br/>
Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians called<br/>
Astarte, queen of heaven, with cresent horns;<br/>
To whose bright image nightly by the moon<br/>
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs;<br/>
In Sion also not unsung, where stood<br/>
Her temple on the offensive mountain, built<br/>
By that uxorious king whose heart, though large,<br/>
Beguiled by fair idolatresses, fell<br/>
To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind,<br/>
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured<br/>
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate<br/>
In amorous ditties all a summer's day,<br/>
While smooth Adonis from his native rock<br/>
Ran purple to the sea, supposed with blood<br/>
Of Thammuz yearly wounded: the love-tale<br/>
Infected Sion's daughters with like heat,<br/>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred porch<br/>
Ezekiel saw, when, by the vision led,<br/>
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries<br/>
Of alienated Judah. Next came one<br/>
Who mourned in earnest, when the captive Ark<br/>
Maimed his brute image, head and hands lopt off,<br/>
In his own temple, on the grunsel-edge,<br/>
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshipers:<br/>
Dagon his name, sea-monster, upward man<br/>
And downward fish; yet had his temple high<br/>
Reared in Azotus, dreaded through the coast<br/>
Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,<br/>
And Accaron and Gaza's frontier bounds.<br/>
Him followed Rimmon, whose delightful seat<br/>
Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks<br/>
Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.<br/>
He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>
A leper once he lost, and gained a king—<br/>
Ahaz, his sottish conqueror, whom he drew<br/>
God's altar to disparage and displace<br/>
For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn<br/>
His odious offerings, and adore the gods<br/>
Whom he had vanquished. After these appeared<br/>
A crew who, under names of old renown—<br/>
Osiris, Isis, Orus, and their train—<br/>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused<br/>
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek<br/>
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms<br/>
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape<br/>
The infection, when their borrowed gold composed<br/>
The calf in Oreb; and the rebel king<br/>
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,<br/>
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox—<br/>
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed<br/>
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke<br/>
Both her first-born and all her bleating gods.<br/>
Belial came last; than whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love,<br/>
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood<br/>
Or altar smoked; yet who more oft than he<br/>
In temples and at altars, when the priest<br/>
Turns atheist, as did Eli's sons, who filled<br/>
With lust and violence the house of God?<br/>
In courts and palaces he also reigns,<br/>
And in luxurious cities, where the noise<br/>
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,<br/>
And injury and outrage; and, when night<br/>
Darkens the streets, then wander forth the sons<br/>
Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>
Witness the streets of Sodom, and that night<br/>
In Gibeah, when the hospitable door<br/>
Exposed a matron, to avoid worse rape.

These were the prime in order and in might:<br/>
The rest were long to tell; though far renowned<br/>
The Ionian gods-of Javan's issue held<br/>
Gods, yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth,<br/>
Their boasted parents;-Titan, Heaven's first-born,<br/>
With his enormous brood, and birthright seized<br/>
By younger Saturn: he from mightier Jove,<br/>
His own and Rhea's son, like measure found;<br/>
So Jove unsurping reigned. These, first in Crete<br/>
And Ida known, thence on the snowy top<br/>
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air,<br/>
Their highest heaven; or on the Delphian cliff,<br/>
Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds<br/>
Of Doric land; or who with Saturn old<br/>
Fled over Adria to the Hesperian fields,<br/>
And o'er the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles.

All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>
Downcast and damp; yet such wherein appeared<br/>
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief<br/>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>
In loss itself; which on his countenance cast<br/>
Like doubtful hue. But he, his wonted pride<br/>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>
Semblance of worth, nor substance, gently raised<br/>
Their fainting courage, and dispelled their fears:<br/>
Then straight commands that, at the war-like sound<br/>
Of trumpets loud and clarions, be upreared<br/>
His mighty standard. That proud honour claimed<br/>
Azazel as his right, a Cherub tall:<br/>
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled<br/>
The imperial ensign; which, full high advanced,<br/>
Shon like a meteo  streaming to the wind,<br/>
With gems and golden lustre rich imblazed,<br/>
Seraphic arms and trophies; all the while<br/>
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds:<br/>
At which the universal host up-sent<br/>
A shout that tore Hell's concave, and beyond<br/>
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night.<br/>
All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>
Ten thousand banners rise into the air,<br/>
With orient colours waving: with them rose<br/>
A forest huge of spears; and thronging helms<br/>
Appeared, and serried shields in thick array<br/>
Of depth immeasurable. Anon they move<br/>
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood<br/>
Of flutes and soft recorders-such as raised<br/>
To highth of noblest temper heroes old<br/>
Arming to battle, and instead of rage<br/>
Deliberate valour breathed, firm, and unmoved<br/>
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat;<br/>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>
With solemn touches troubled thoughts, and chase<br/>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>
From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they,<br/>
Breathing united force with fixed thought,<br/>
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed<br/>
Their painful steps o'er the burnt soil. And now<br/>
Advanced in view they stand-a horrid front<br/>
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms, in guise<br/>
Of warriors old, with ordered spear and shield,<br/>
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief<br/>
Had to impose. He through the armed files<br/>
Darts his experienced eye, and soon traverse<br/>
The whole battalion views-their order due,<br/>
Their visages and stature as of Gods;<br/>
Their number last he sums. And now his heart<br/>
Distends with pride, and, hardening in his strength,<br/>
Glories: for never, since created Man,<br/>
Met such imbodied force as, named with these,<br/>
Could merit more than that small infantry<br/>
Warred on by cranes-though all the giant brood<br/>
Of Phlegra with the heroic race were joined<br/>
That fought at Thebes and Ilium, on each side<br/>
Mixed with auxiliar gods; and what resounds<br/>
In fable or romance of Uther's son,<br/>
Begirt with British and Armoric knights;<br/>
And all who since, baptized or infidel,<br/>
Jousted in Aspramont, or Montalban,<br/>
Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond,<br/>
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore<br/>
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell<br/>
By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond<br/>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observed<br/>
Their dread Commander. He, above the rest<br/>
In shape and gesture proudly eminent,<br/>
Stood like a tower. His form had yet not lost<br/>
All her original brightness, nor appeared<br/>
Less than Archangel ruined, and the excess<br/>
Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen<br/>
Looks through the horizontal misty air<br/>
Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the moon,<br/>
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds<br/>
On half the nations, and with fear of change<br/>
Perplexes monarchs. Darkened so, yet shon<br/>
Above them all the Archangel: but his face<br/>
Deep scars of thunder had intrenched, and care<br/>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows<br/>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride<br/>
Waiting revenge. Cruel his eye, but cast<br/>
Signs of remorse and passion, to behold<br/>
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>
(Far other once beheld in bliss), condemned<br/>
For ever now to have their lot in pain—<br/>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced<br/>
Of Heaven, and from eternal splendours flung<br/>
For his revolt-yet faithful how they stood,<br/>
Their glory withered; as, when heaven's fire<br/>
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines,<br/>
With singed top their stately growth, though bare,<br/>
Stands on the blasted heath. He now prepared<br/>
To speak; whereat their doubled ranks they bend<br/>
From wing to wing, and half enclose him round<br/>
With all his peers: Attention held them mute.<br/>
Thrice he assayed, and thrice, in spite of scorn,<br/>
Tears, such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>
Words interwove with sighs found out their way:—

"O myriads of immortal Spirits! O Powers<br/>
Matchless, but with the Almighty!-and that strife<br/>
Was not inglorious, though the event was dire,<br/>
As this place testifies, and this dire change,<br/>
Hateful to utter. But what power of mind,<br/>
Foreseeing or presaging, from the depth<br/>
Of knowledge past or present, could have feared<br/>
How such united force of gods, how such<br/>
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>
For who can yet believe, though after loss,<br/>
That all these puissant legions, whose exile<br/>
Hath emptied Heaven, shall fail to reascend,<br/>
Self-raised, and re-possess their native seat?<br/>
For me, be witness all the host of Heaven,<br/>
If counsels different, or danger shunned<br/>
By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns<br/>
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure<br/>
Sat on his throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>
Consent or custom, and his regal state<br/>
Put forth at full, but still his strength concealed—<br/>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own,<br/>
So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>
New war provoked: our better part remains<br/>
To work in close design, by fraud or guile,<br/>
What force effected not; that he no less<br/>
At length from us may find, Who overcomes<br/>
By force hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>
There went a fame in Heaven that He ere long<br/>
Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>
A generation whom his choice regard<br/>
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven.<br/>
Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps<br/>
Our first eruption-thither, or elsewhere;<br/>
For this infernal pit shall never hold<br/>
Caelestial Spirits in bondage, nor the Abyss<br/>
Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts<br/>
Full counsel must mature. Peace is despaired;<br/>
For who can think submission? War, then, war<br/>
Open or understood, must be resolved."<br/>
He spake; and, to confirm his words, out-flew<br/>
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>
Far around illumined Hell. Highly they raged<br/>
Again the Highest and fierce with grasped arms<br/>
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven.<br/>
There stood a hill not far, whose griesly top<br/>
Belched fire and rowling smoke; the rest entire<br/>
Shown with a glossy scurf-undoubted sign<br/>
That in his womb was hid metallic ore,<br/>
The work of sulphur. Thither, winged with speed,<br/>
A numerous brigad hastened: as when bands<br/>
Of pioners, with spade and pickaxe armed,<br/>
Forerun the royal camp, to trench a field,<br/>
Or cast a rampart. Mammon led them on—<br/>
Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>
From Heaven; for even in Heaven his looks and<br/>
thoughts

Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>
The riches of Heaven's pavement, trodden gold,<br/>
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed<br/>
In vision beatific. By him first<br/>
Men also, and by suggestion taught<br/>
Ransacked the Centre, and with impious hands<br/>
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth<br/>
For treasures better hid. Soon had his crew<br/>
Opened into the hill a spacious wound,<br/>
And digged out ribs of gold. Let none admire<br/>
That riches grow in Hell: that soil may best<br/>
Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those<br/>
Who boast in mortal things, and wondering tell<br/>
Of Babel and the works of Memphian kings,<br/>
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame,<br/>
And strength, and art, are easily outdone<br/>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>
What in an age they, with incessant toil<br/>
And hands innumerable, scarce perform.<br/>
Nigh on the plain, in many cells prepared,<br/>
That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>
Sluiced from the lake, a second multitude<br/>
With wondrous art founded the massy ore,<br/>
Severing each kind, and scummed the bullion-dross.<br/>
A third as soon had formed within the ground<br/>
A various mould, and from the boiling cells<br/>
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook;<br/>
As in an organ, from one blast of wind,<br/>
To many a row of pipes the sound-board breathes.<br/>
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge<br/>
Rose like an exhalation, with the sound<br/>
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet—<br/>
Built like a temple, where pilasters round<br/>
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>
With golden architrave; nor did there want<br/>
Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven:<br/>
The roof was fretted gold. Not Babilon<br/>
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence<br/>
Equalled in all their glories, to inshrine<br/>
Belus or Serapis their gods, or seat<br/>
Their kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove<br/>
In wealth and luxury. The ascending pile<br/>
Stood fixed her stately highth; and straight the doors<br/>
Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide<br/>
Within, her ample spaces o'er the smooth<br/>
And level pavement: from the arched roof,<br/>
Pendent by subtle magic, many a row<br/>
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets, fed<br/>
With naphtha and asphaltus, yielded light<br/>
As from a sky. The hasty multitude<br/>
Admiring entered; and the work some praise,<br/>
And some the Architect. His hand was known<br/>
In Heaven by many a towered structure high,<br/>
Where sceptred Angels held their residence,<br/>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>
Each in his hierarchy, the Orders bright.<br/>
Nor was his name unheard or unadored<br/>
In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land<br/>
Men called him Mulciber; and how he fell<br/>
From Heaven they fabled, thrown by angry Jove<br/>
Sheer o'er the crystal battlements: from morn<br/>
To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,<br/>
A summer's day, and with the setting sun<br/>
Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star,<br/>
On Lemnos, the Aegaean isle. Thus they relate,<br/>
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>
Fell long before; nor aught availed him now<br/>
To have built in Heaven high towers; nor did he scape<br/>
By all his engines, but was headlong sent,<br/>
With his industrious crew, to build in Hell.

Meanwhile the winged Haralds, by command<br/>
Of sovran power, with awful ceremony<br/>
And trumpet's sound, throughout the host proclaim<br/>
A solemn council forthwith to be held<br/>
At Pandaemonium, the high capital<br/>
Of Satan and his peers. Their summons called<br/>
From every band and squared regiment<br/>
By place or choice the worthiest: they anon<br/>
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>
Attended. All access was thronged; the gates<br/>
And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall<br/>
(Though like a covered field, where champions bold<br/>
Wont ride in armed, and at the Soldan's chair<br/>
Defied the best of Panim chivalry<br/>
To mortal combat, or career with lance),<br/>
Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees<br/>
In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br/>
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive<br/>
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,<br/>
The suburb of their straw-built citadel,<br/>
New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer<br/>
Their state-affairs: so thick the aerie crowd<br/>
Swarmed and were straitened; till, the signal given,<br/>
Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed<br/>
In bigness to surpass Earth's giant sons,<br/>
Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>
Throng numberless-like that pygmean race<br/>
Beyond the Indian mount; or faery elves,<br/>
Whose midnight revels, by a forest-side<br/>
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,<br/>
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon<br/>
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth<br/>
Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance<br/>
Intent, with jocond music charm his ear;<br/>
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>
Reduced their shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>
Though without number still, amidst the hall<br/>
Of that infernal court. But far within,<br/>
And in their own dimensions like themselves,<br/>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>
In close recess and secret conclave sat,<br/>
A thousand demi-gods on golden seats,<br/>
Frequent and full. After short silence then,<br/>
And summons read, the great consult began.

<h2>Book 2</h2>

High on a throne of royal state, which far<br/>
Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,<br/>
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand<br/>
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,<br/>
Satan exalted sat, by merit raised<br/>
To that bad eminence; and, from despair<br/>
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br/>
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br/>
Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,<br/>
His proud imaginations thus displayed:—

"Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heaven!—<br/>
For, since no deep within her gulf can hold<br/>
Immortal vigour, though oppressed and fallen,<br/>
I give not Heaven for lost: from this descent<br/>
Celestial Virtues rising will appear<br/>
More glorious and more dread than from no fall,<br/>
And trust themselves to fear no second fate!—<br/>
Me though just right, and the fixed laws of Heaven,<br/>
Did first create your leader-next, free choice,<br/>
With what besides in council or in fight<br/>
Hath been achieved of merit-yet this loss,<br/>
Thus far at least recovered, hath much more<br/>
Established in a safe, unenvied throne,<br/>
Yielded with full consent. The happier state<br/>
In Heaven, which follows dignity, mightadraw<br/>
Envy from each inferior; but who here<br/>
Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br/>
Foremost to stand against the Thunderer's aim<br/>
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br/>
Of endless pain? Where there is, then, no good<br/>
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br/>
From faction: for none sure will claim in Hell<br/>
Precedence; none whose portion is so small<br/>
Of present pain that with ambitious mind<br/>
Will covet more! With this advantage, then,<br/>
To union, and firm faith, and firm accord,<br/>
More than can be in Heaven, we now return<br/>
To claim our just inheritance of old,<br/>
Surer to prosper than prosperity<br/>
Could have assured us; and by what best way,<br/>
Whether of open war or covert guile,<br/>
We now debate. Who can advise may speak."

He ceased; and next him Moloch, sceptred king,<br/>
Stood up-the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br/>
That fought in Heaven, now fiercer by despair.<br/>
His trust was with the Eternal to be deemed<br/>
Equal in strength, and rather than be less<br/>
Cared not to be at all; with that care lost<br/>
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse,<br/>
He recked not, and these words thereafter spake:—

"My sentence is for open war. Of wiles,<br/>
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br/>
Contrive who need, or when they need; not now.<br/>
For, while they sit contriving, shall the rest—<br/>
Millions that stand in arms, and longing wait<br/>
The signal to ascend-sit lingering here,<br/>
Heaven's fugitives, and for their dwelling-place<br/>
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame,<br/>
The prison of His tyranny who reigns<br/>
By our delay? No! let us rather choose,<br/>
Armed with Hell-flames and fury, all at once<br/>
O'er Heaven's high towers to force resistless way,<br/>
Turning our tortures into horrid arms<br/>
Against the torturer; when, to meet the noise<br/>
Of his almighty engine, he shall hear<br/>
Infernal thunder, and, for lightning, see<br/>
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br/>
Among his Angels and his throne itself<br/>
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire,<br/>
His own invented torments. But perhaps<br/>
The way seems difficult, and steep to scale<br/>
With upright wing against a higher foe!<br/>
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br/>
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still,<br/>
That in our proper motion we ascend<br/>
Up to our native seat; descent and fall<br/>
To us is adverse. Who but felt of late,<br/>
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear<br/>
Insulting, and pursued us through the Deep,<br/>
With what compulsion and laborious flight<br/>
We sunk thus low? The ascent is easy, then;<br/>
The event is feared! Should we again provoke<br/>
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br/>
To our destruction, if there be in Hell<br/>
Fear to be worse destroyed! What can be worse<br/>
Than to dwell here, driven out from bliss, condemned<br/>
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;<br/>
Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br/>
Must exercise us without hope of end<br/>
The vassals of his anger, when the scourge<br/>
Inexorably, and the torturing hour,<br/>
Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus,<br/>
We should be quite abolished, and expire.<br/>
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br/>
His utmost ire? which, to the highth enraged,<br/>
Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br/>
To nothing this essential-happier far<br/>
Than miserable to have eternal being!—<br/>
Or, if our substance be indeed Divine,<br/>
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br/>
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br/>
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,<br/>
And with perpetual inroads to alarm,<br/>
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:<br/>
Which, if not victory, is yet revenge."

He ended frowning, and his look denounced<br/>
Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous<br/>
To less than gods. On the other side up rose<br/>
Belial, in act more graceful and humane.<br/>
A fairer person lost not Heaven; he seemed<br/>
For dignity composed, and high exploit.<br/>
But all was false and hollow, though his tongue<br/>
Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear<br/>
The better reason, to perplex and dash<br/>
Maturest counsels: for his thoughts were low—<br/>
To vice industrious, but to nobler deeds<br/>
Timorous and slothful. Yet he pleased the ear,<br/>
And with persuasive accent thus began:—

"I should be much for open war, O Peers,<br/>
As not behind in hate, if what was urged<br/>
Main reason to persuade immediate war<br/>
Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast<br/>
Ominous conjecture on the whole success;<br/>
When he who most excels in fact of arms,<br/>
In what he counsels and in what excels<br/>
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br/>
And utter dissolution, as the scope<br/>
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br/>
First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled<br/>
With armed watch, that render all access<br/>
Impregnable: oft on the bordering Deep<br/>
Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing<br/>
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,<br/>
Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way<br/>
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br/>
With blackest insurrection to confound<br/>
Heaven's purest light, yet our great Enemy,<br/>
All incorruptible, would on his throne<br/>
Sit unpolluted, and the ethereal mould,<br/>
Incapable of stain, would soon expel<br/>
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,<br/>
Victorious. Thus repulsed, our final hope<br/>
Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br/>
The Almighty Victor to spend all his rage:<br/>
And that must end us; that must be our cure—<br/>
To be no more. Sad cure! for who would lose,<br/>
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/>
Those thoughts that wander through eternity,<br/>
To perish rather, swallowed up and lost<br/>
In the wide womb of uncreated Night,<br/>
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,<br/>
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br/>
Can give it, or will ever? How he can<br/>
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br/>
Will He, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br/>
Belike through impotence or unaware,<br/>
To give his enemies their wish, and end<br/>
Them in his anger whom his anger saves<br/>
To punish endless? 'Wherefore cease we, then?'<br/>
Say they who counsel war; 'we are decreed,<br/>
Reserved, and destined to eternal woe;<br/>
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br/>
What can we suffer worse?' Is this, then, worst—<br/>
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in arms?<br/>
What when we fled amain, pursued and strook<br/>
With Heaven's afflicting thunder, and eesought<br/>
The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed<br/>
A refuge from those wounds. Or when we lay<br/>
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse.<br/>
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires,<br/>
Awaked, should blow them into sevenfold rage,<br/>
And plunge us in the flames; or from above<br/>
Should intermitted vengeance arm again<br/>
His red right hand to plague us? What if all<br/>
Her stores were opened, and this firmament<br/>
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire,<br/>
Impendent horrors, threatening hideous fall<br/>
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps,<br/>
Designing or exhorting glorious war,<br/>
Caught in a fiery tempest, shall be hurled.<br/>
Each on his rock transfixed, the sport and prey<br/>
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br/>
Under yon boiling ocean, wrapt in chains,<br/>
There to converse with everlasting groans,<br/>
Unrespited, unpitied, unreprieved,<br/>
Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse.<br/>
War, therefore, open or concealed, alike<br/>
My voice dissuades; for what can force or guile<br/>
With Him, or who deceive His mind, whose eye<br/>
Views all things at one view? He from Heaven's highth

All these our motions vain sees and derides,<br/>
Not more almighty to resist our might<br/>
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br/>
Shall we, then, live thus vile-the race of Heaven<br/>
Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here<br/>
Chains and these torments? Better these than worse<br/>
By my advice; since fate inevitable<br/>
Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,<br/>
The Victor's will. To suffer, as to do,<br/>
Our strength is equal; nor the law unjust<br/>
That so ordains. This was at first resolved,<br/>
If we were wise, against so great a foe<br/>
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br/>
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold<br/>
And ventrous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear<br/>
What yet they know must follow-to endure<br/>
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br/>
The sentence of their conqueror. This is now<br/>
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br/>
Our Supreme Foe in time may such remit<br/>
His anger, and perhaps, thus far removed,<br/>
Not mind us not offending, satisfied<br/>
With what is punished; whence these raging fires<br/>
Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.<br/>
Our purer essence then will overcome<br/>
Their noxious vapour; or, inured, not feel;<br/>
Or, changed at length, and to the place conformed<br/>
In temper and in nature, will receive<br/>
Familiar the fierce heat; and void of pain,<br/>
This horror will grow mild, this darkness light;<br/>
Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br/>
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br/>
Worth waiting-since our present lot appears<br/>
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br/>
If we procure not to ourselves more woe."

Thus Belial, with words clothed in reason's garb,<br/>
Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth,<br/>
Not peace; and after him thus Mammon spake:—

"Either to disinthrone the King of Heaven<br/>
We war, if war be best, or to regain<br/>
Our own right lost. Him to unthrone we then<br/>
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield<br/>
To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.<br/>
The former, vain to hope, argues as vain<br/>
The latter; for what place can be for us<br/>
Within Heaven's bound, unless Heaven's Lord Supreme<br/>
We overpower? Suppose he should relent,<br/>
And publish grace to all, on promise made<br/>
Of new subjection; with what eyes could we<br/>
Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br/>
Strict laws imposed, to celebrate his throne<br/>
With warbled hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br/>
Forced Halleluiahs, while he lordly sits<br/>
Our envied sovran, and his altar breathes<br/>
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers,<br/>
Our servile offerings? This must be our task<br/>
In Heaven, this our delight. How wearisome<br/>
Eternity so spent in worship paid<br/>
To whom we hate! Let us not then pursue,<br/>
By force impossible, by leave obtained<br/>
Unacceptable, though in Heaven, our state<br/>
Of splendid vassalage; but rather seek<br/>
Our own good from ourselves, and from our own<br/>
Live to ourselves, though in this vast recess,<br/>
Free and none accountable, preferring<br/>
Hard liberty before the easy yoke<br/>
Of servile pomp. Our greatness will appear<br/>
Then most conspicuous when great things of small,<br/>
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse,<br/>
We can create, and in what place soe'er<br/>
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br/>
Through labour and indurance. This deep world<br/>
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst<br/>
Thick clouds and dark doth Heaven's all-ruling Sire<br/>
Choose to reside, his glory unobscured,<br/>
And with the majesty of darkness round<br/>
Covers his throne, from whence deep thunders roar,<br/>
Mustering their rage, and Heaven resembles Hell!<br/>
As He our darkness, cannot we His light<br/>
Imitate when we please? This desart soil<br/>
Wants not her hidden lustre, gems and gold;<br/>
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise<br/>
Magnificence; and what can Heaven shew more?<br/>
Our torments also may, in length of time,<br/>
Become our elements, these piercing fires<br/>
As soft as now severe, our temper changed<br/>
Into their temper; which must needs remove<br/>
The sensible of pain. All things invite<br/>
To peaceful counsels, and the settled state<br/>
Of order, how in safety best we may<br/>
Compose our present evils, with regard<br/>
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br/>
All thoughts of war. Ye have what I advise."

He scarce had finished, when such murmur filled<br/>
The assembly as when hollow rocks retain<br/>
The sound of blustering winds, which all night long<br/>
Had roused the sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br/>
Seafaring men o'erwatched, whose bark by chance,<br/>
Or pinnace, anchors in a craggy bay<br/>
After the tempest. Such applause was heard<br/>
As Mammon ended, and his sentence pleased,<br/>
Advising peace: for such another field<br/>
They dreaded worse than Hell; so much the fear<br/>
Of thunder and the sword of Michael<br/>
Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br/>
To found this nether empire, which might rise,<br/>
By policy and long process' of time,<br/>
In emulation opposite to Heaven.<br/>
Which when Beelzebub perceived-than whom,<br/>
Satan except, none higher sat-with grave<br/>
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seemed<br/>
A pillar of state. Deep on his front engraven<br/>
Deliberation sat, and public care;<br/>
And princely counsel in his face yet shon,<br/>
Majestic, though in ruin. Sage he stood,<br/>
With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear<br/>
The weight of mightiest monarchies; his look<br/>
Drew audience and attention still as night<br/>
Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake:—

"Thrones and Imperial Powers, Offspring of Heaven,<br/>
Ethereal Virtues! or these titles now<br/>
Must we renounce, and, changing style, be called<br/>
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br/>
Inclines-here to continue, and build up here<br/>
A growing empire; doubtless! while we dream;<br/>
And know not that the king of Heaven hath doomed<br/>
This place our dungeon-not our safe retreat<br/>
Beyond his potent arm, to live exempt<br/>
From Heaven's high jurisdiction, in new league<br/>
Banded against his throne, but to remain<br/>
In strictest bondage, though thus far removed,<br/>
Under the inevitable curb, reserved<br/>
His captive multitude. For He, be sure,<br/>
In highth of depth, still first and last will reign<br/>
Sole king, and of his kingdom lose no part<br/>
By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br/>
His empire, and with iron sceptre rule<br/>
Us here, as with his golden those in Heaven,<br/>
What sit we then projecting peace and war?<br/>
War hath determined us and foiled with loss<br/>
Irreparable; terms of peace yet none<br/>
Voutsafed or sought; for what peace will be given<br/>
To us enslaved, but custody severe,<br/>
And stripes and arbitrary punishment<br/>
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br/>
But, to out power, hostility and hate,<br/>
Untamed reluctance, and revenge, though slow,<br/>
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least<br/>
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoice<br/>
In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br/>
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br/>
With dangerous expedition to invade<br/>
Heaven, whose high walls fear no assault or siege,<br/>
Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find<br/>
Some easier enterprise? There is a place<br/>
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven<br/>
Err not)-another World, the happy seat<br/>
Of some new rave, called Man, about this time<br/>
To be created like to us, though less<br/>
In power and excellence, but favoured more<br/>
Of Him who rules above; so was His will<br/>
Pronounced among the gods, and by an oath<br/>
That shook Heaven's whole circumference confirmed.<br/>
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br/>
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould<br/>
Or substance, how endued, and what their power<br/>
And where their weakness; how attempted best,<br/>
By force or subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,<br/>
And Heaven's high Arbitrator sit secure<br/>
In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,<br/>
The utmost border of his kingdom, left<br/>
To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,<br/>
Some advantageous act may be achieved<br/>
By sudden onset-either with Hell-fire<br/>
To waste his whole creation, or possess<br/>
All as our own, and drive, as we are driven,<br/>
The puny habitants; or, if not drive,<br/>
Seduce them to our party, that their God<br/>
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand<br/>
Abolish his own works. This would surpass<br/>
Common revenge, and interrupt His joy<br/>
In our confusion, and our joy upraise<br/>
In His disturbance; when his darling sons,<br/>
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br/>
Their frail original, and faded bliss—<br/>
Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth<br/>
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br/>
Hatching vain empires." Thus Beelzebub,<br/>
Pleaded his devilish counsel-first devised<br/>
By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,<br/>
But from the author of all ill, could spring<br/>
So deep a malice, to confound the race<br/>
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br/>
To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br/>
The great Creator? But their spite still serves<br/>
His glory to augment. The bold design<br/>
Pleased highly those Infernal States, and joy<br/>
Sparkled in all their eyes: with full assent<br/>
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews:—<br/>
"Well have ye judged, well ended long debate,<br/>
Synod of Gods and, like to what ye are,<br/>
Great things resolved, which from the lowest deep<br/>
Will once more lift us up, in spite of Fate,<br/>
Nearer our ancient Seat-perhaps in view<br/>
Of those bright confines, whence, with neighbouring arms,

And opportune excursion, we may chance<br/>
Re-enter Heaven; or else in some mild zone<br/>
Dwell, not unvisited of Heaven's fair light,<br/>
Secure, and at the brightening orient beam<br/>
Purge off this gloom: the soft delicious air,<br/>
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires,<br/>
Shall breathe her balm. But, first, whom shall we send

In search of this new World? whom shall we find<br/>
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet<br/>
The dark, unbottomed, infinite Abyss,<br/>
And through the palpable obscure find out<br/>
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight,<br/>
Upborne with indefatigable wings<br/>
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br/>
The happy Isle? What strength, what art, can then<br/>
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe<br/>
Through the strict senteries and stations thick<br/>
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need<br/>
All circumspection: and we now no less<br/>
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send<br/>
The weight of all, and our last hope, relies."

This said, he sat; and expectation held<br/>
His look suspense, awaiting who appeared<br/>
To second, or oppose, or undertake<br/>
The perilous attempt. But all sat mute,<br/>
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each<br/>
In other's countenance read his own dismay,<br/>
Astonished. None among the choice and prime<br/>
Of those Heaven-warring champions could be found<br/>
So hardy as to proffer or accept,<br/>
Alone, the dreadful voyage; till, at last,<br/>
Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised<br/>
Above his fellows, with monarchal pride<br/>
Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:—

"O Progeny of Heaven! Empyreal Thrones!<br/>
With reason hath deep silence and demur<br/>
Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way<br/>
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light.<br/>
Our prison strong, this huge convex of fire,<br/>
Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br/>
Ninefold; and gates of burning adamant,<br/>
Barred over us, prohibit all egress.<br/>
These passed, if any pass, the void profound<br/>
Of unessential Night receives him next,<br/>
Wide-gaping, and with utter loss of being<br/>
Threatens him, plunged in that abortive gulf.<br/>
If thence he scape, into whatever world,<br/>
Or unknown region, what remains him less<br/>
Than unknown dangers, and as hard escape?<br/>
But I should ill become this throne, O Peers,<br/>
And this imperial sovranty, adorned<br/>
With splendour, armed with power, if aught proposed<br/>
And judged of public moment in the shape<br/>
Of difficulty or danger, could deter<br/>
Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume<br/>
These royalties, and not refuse to reign,<br/>
Refusing to accept as great a share<br/>
Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br/>
To him who reigns, and so much to him due<br/>
Of hazard more as he above the rest<br/>
High honoured sits? Go, therefore, mighty Powers,<br/>
Terror of Heaven, though fallen; intend at home,<br/>
While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br/>
The present misery, and render Hell<br/>
More tolerable; if there be cure or charm<br/>
To respite, or deceive, or slack the pain<br/>
Of this ill mansion: intermit no watch<br/>
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad<br/>
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br/>
Deliverance for us all. This enterprise<br/>
None shall partake with me." Thus saying, rose<br/>
The Monarch, and prevented all reply;<br/>
Prudent lest, from his resolution raised,<br/>
Others among the chief might offer now,<br/>
Certain to be refused, what erst they feared,<br/>
And, so refused, might in opinion stand<br/>
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br/>
Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they<br/>
Dreaded not more the adventure than his voice<br/>
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose.<br/>
Their rising all at once was as the sound<br/>
Of thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend<br/>
With awful reverence prone, and as a God<br/>
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven.<br/>
Nor failed they to express how much they praised<br/>
That for the general safety he despised<br/>
His own: for neither do the Spirits damned<br/>
Lose all their virtue; lest bad men should boast<br/>
Their specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br/>
Or close ambition varnished o'er with zeal.

Thus they their doubtful consultations dark<br/>
Ended, rejoicing in their matchless Chief:<br/>
As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds<br/>
Ascending, while the North-wind sleeps, o'erspread<br/>
Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element<br/>
Scowls o'er the darkened lantskip snow or shower,<br/>
If chance the radiant sun, with farewell sweet,<br/>
Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,<br/>
The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds<br/>
Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.<br/>
O shame to men! Devil with devil damned<br/>
Firm concord holds; men only disagree<br/>
Of creatures rational, though under hope<br/>
Of heavenly grace, and, God proclaiming peace,<br/>
Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife<br/>
Among themselves, and levy cruel wars<br/>
Wasting the earth, each other to destroy:<br/>
As if (which might induce us to accord)<br/>
Man had not hellish foes enow besides,<br/>
That day and night for his destruction wait!

The Stygian council thus dissolved; and forth<br/>
In order came the grand Infernal Peers:<br/>
Midst came their mighty Paramount, and seemed<br/>
Alone the Antagonist of Heaven, nor less<br/>
Than Hell's dread Emperor, with pomp supreme,<br/>
And god-like imitated state: him round<br/>
A globe of fiery Seraphim inclosed<br/>
With bright imblazonry, and horrent arms.<br/>
Then of their session ended they bid cry<br/>
With trumpet's regal sound the great result:<br/>
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br/>
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy,<br/>
By harald's voice explained; the hollow Abyss<br/>
Heard far and wide, and all the host of Hell<br/>
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim.<br/>
Thence more at ease their minds, and somewhat raised<br/>
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged Powers<br/>
Disband; and, wandering, each his several way<br/>
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice,<br/>
Leads him perplexed, where he may likeliest find<br/>
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br/>
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br/>
Part on the plain, or in the air sublime,<br/>
Upon the wing or in swift race contend,<br/>
As at the Olympian games or Pythian fields;<br/>
Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal<br/>
With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form:<br/>
As when, to warn proud cities, war appears<br/>
Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush<br/>
To battle in the clouds; before each van<br/>
Prick forth the aerie knights, and couch their spears,<br/>
Till thickest legions close; with feats of arms<br/>
From either end of heaven the welkin burns.<br/>
Others, with vast Typhoean rage, more fell,<br/>
Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air<br/>
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wild uproar:—<br/>
As when Alcides, from Oechalia crowned<br/>
With conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore<br/>
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines,<br/>
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw<br/>
Into the Euboic sea. Others, more mild,<br/>
Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br/>
With notes angelical to many a harp<br/>
Their own heroic deeds, and hapless fall<br/>
By doom of battle, and complain that Fate<br/>
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br/>
Their song was partial; but the harmony<br/>
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br/>
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br/>
The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet<br/>
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense)<br/>
Others apart sat on a hill retired,<br/>
In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high<br/>
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate—<br/>
Fixed fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute—<br/>
And found no end, in wandering mazes lost.<br/>
Of good and evil much they argued then,<br/>
Of happiness and final misery,<br/>
Passion and apathy, and glory and shame:<br/>
Vain wisdom all, and false philosophy!—<br/>
Yet, with a pleasing sorcery, could charm<br/>
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br/>
Fallacious hope, or arm the obdured breast<br/>
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br/>
Another part, in squadrons and gross bands,<br/>
On bold adventure to discover wide<br/>
That dismal world, if any clime perhaps<br/>
Might yield them easier habitation, bend<br/>
Four ways their flying march, along the banks<br/>
Of four infernal rivers, that disgorge<br/>
Into the burning lake their baleful streams—<br/>
Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;<br/>
Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;<br/>
Cocytus, named of lamentation loud<br/>
Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,<br/>
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br/>
Far off from these, a slow and silent stream,<br/>
Lethe, the river of oblivion, rowls<br/>
Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks<br/>
Forthwith his former state and being forgets—<br/>
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br/>
Beyond this flood a frozen continent<br/>
Lies dark and wild, beat with perpetual storms<br/>
Of whirlwind and dire hail, which on firm land<br/>
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br/>
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br/>
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog<br/>
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old,<br/>
Where armies whole have sunk: the parching air<br/>
Burns frore, and cold performs the effect of fire.<br/>
Thither, by harpy-footed Furies haled,<br/>
At certain revolutions all the damned<br/>
Are brought; and feel by turns the bitter change<br/>
Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,<br/>
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice<br/>
Their soft ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br/>
Immovable, infixed, and frozen round<br/>
Periods of time,-thence hurried back to fire.<br/>
They ferry over this Lethean sound<br/>
Both to and fro, their sorrow to augment,<br/>
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br/>
The tempting stream, with one small drop to lose<br/>
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br/>
All in one moment, and so near the brink;<br/>
But Fate withstands, and, to oppose the attempt,<br/>
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards<br/>
The ford, and of itself the water flies<br/>
All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br/>
The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on<br/>
In confused march forlorn, the adventrous bands,<br/>
With shuddering horror pale, and eyes aghast,<br/>
Viewed first their lamentable lot, and found<br/>
No rest. Through many a dark and dreary vale<br/>
They passed, and many a region dolorous,<br/>
O'er many a frozen, many a fiery Alp,<br/>
Rocks, caves, lakes, fens, bogs, dens, and shades of death—<br/>
A universe of death, which God by curse<br/>
Created evil, for evil only good;<br/>
Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds,<br/>
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br/>
Abominable, inutterable, and worse<br/>
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,<br/>
Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimaeras dire.

Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man,<br/>
Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,<br/>
Puts on swift wings, and toward the gates of Hell<br/>
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes<br/>
He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left;<br/>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars<br/>
Up to the fiery concave towering high.<br/>
As when far off at sea a fleet descried<br/>
Hangs in the clouds, by aequinoctial winds<br/>
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles<br/>
Of Ternate and Tidore, whence merchants bring<br/>
Their spicy drugs; they on the trading flood,<br/>
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,<br/>
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed<br/>
Far off the flying Fiend. At last appear<br/>
Hell-hounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,<br/>
And thrice threefold the gates; three folds were brass,<br/>
Three iron, three of adamantine rock,<br/>
Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,<br/>
Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat<br/>
On either side a formidable Shape.<br/>
The one seemed a woman to the waist, and fair,<br/>
But ended foul in many a scaly fold,<br/>
Voluminous and vast-a serpent armed<br/>
With mortal sting. About her middle round<br/>
A cry of Hell-hounds never-ceasing barked<br/>
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung<br/>
A hideous peal; yet, when they list, would creep,<br/>
If aught disturbed their noise, into her womb,<br/>
And kennel there; yet there still barked and howled<br/>
With in unseen. Far less abhorred than these<br/>
Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts<br/>
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore;<br/>
Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when, called<br/>
In secret, riding through the air she comes,<br/>
Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br/>
With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon<br/>
Eclipses at their charms. Thd other Shape—<br/>
If shape it might be called that shape had none<br/>
Distinguishable in member, joint, or limb;<br/>
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed,<br/>
For each seemed either-black it stood as Night,<br/>
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br/>
And shook a dreadful dart: what seemed his head<br/>
The likeness of a kingly crown had on.<br/>
Satan was now at hand, and from his seat<br/>
The monster moving onward came as fast<br/>
With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.<br/>
The undaunted Fiend what this might be admired—<br/>
Admired, not feared (God and his Son except,<br/>
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned),<br/>
And with disdainful look thus first began:—

"Whence and what art thou, execrable Shape,<br/>
That dar'st though grim and terrible, advance<br/>
Thy miscreated front athwart my way<br/>
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,<br/>
That be assured, without leave asked of thee.<br/>
Retire; or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,<br/>
Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heaven."

To whom the Goblin, full of wrauth, replied:—<br/>
"Art thou that Traitor-Angel, art thou he,<br/>
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith, till then<br/>
Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons,<br/>
Conjured against the Highest-for which both thou<br/>
And they, outcast from God, are here condemned<br/>
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?<br/>
And reckon'st thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven,<br/>
Hell-doomed, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,<br/>
Where I reign king, and, to enrage thee more,<br/>
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment,<br/>
False fugitive; and to thy speed add wings,<br/>
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue<br/>
Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart<br/>
Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before."

So spake the griesly Terror, and in shape,<br/>
So speaking and so threatening, grew tenfold<br/>
More dreadful and deform. On the other side,<br/>
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood<br/>
Unterrified, and like a comet burned,<br/>
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge<br/>
In the artick sky, and from his horrid hair<br/>
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head<br/>
Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands<br/>
No second stroke intend; and such a frown<br/>
Each cast at the other as when two black clouds,<br/>
With Heaven's artillery fraught, come rattling on<br/>
Over the Caspian,-then stand front to front<br/>
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow<br/>
To join their dark encounter in mid-air.<br/>
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell<br/>
Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;<br/>
For never but once more was either like<br/>
To meet so great a foe. And now great deeds<br/>
Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,<br/>
Had not the snaky Sorceress, that sat<br/>
Fast by Hell-gate and kept the fatal key,<br/>
Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.

"O father, what intends thy hand," she cried,<br/>
"Against thy only son? What fury, O son,<br/>
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart<br/>
Against thy father's head? And know'st for whom?<br/>
For Him who sits above, and laughs the while<br/>
At thee, ordained his drudge to execute<br/>
Whate'er his wrauth, which He calls justice, bids—<br/>
His wrauth, which one day will destroy ye both!"

She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest<br/>
Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:—

"So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange<br/>
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,<br/>
Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds<br/>
What it intends, till first I know of thee<br/>
What thing thou art, thus double-formed, and why<br/>
In this infernal vale first met, thou call'st<br/>
Me father, and that fantasm call'st my son.<br/>
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now<br/>
Sight more detestable than him and thee."

To whom thus the Portress of Hell-gate replied:—<br/>
"Hast thou forgot me, then; and do I seem<br/>
Now in thine eyes so foul?-once deemed so fair<br/>
In Heaven, when at the assembly, and in sight<br/>
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined<br/>
In bold conspiracy against Heaven's King,<br/>
All on a sudden miserable pain<br/>
Surprised thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzy swum<br/>
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br/>
Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,<br/>
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,<br/>
Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,<br/>
Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized<br/>
All the host of Heaven; back they recoiled afraid<br/>
At first, and called me Sin, and for a sign<br/>
Portentous held me; but, familiar grown,<br/>
I pleased, and with attractive graces won<br/>
The most averse-thee chiefly, who, full oft<br/>
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing,<br/>
Becam'st enamoured; and such joy thou took'st<br/>
With me in secret that my womb conceived<br/>
A growing burden. Meanwhile war arose,<br/>
And fields were fought in Heaven: wherein remained<br/>
(For what could else?) to our Almighty Foe<br/>
Clear victory; to our part loss and rout<br/>
Through all the Empyrean. Down they fell,<br/>
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven, down<br/>
Into this Deep; and in the general fall<br/>
I also: at which time this powerful Key<br/>
Into my hands was given, with charge to keep<br/>
These gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br/>
Without my opening. Pensive here I sat<br/>
Alone; but long I sat not, till my womb,<br/>
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown,<br/>
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br/>
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest,<br/>
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way,<br/>
Tore through my entrails, that, with fear and pain<br/>
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br/>
Transformed: but he my inbred enemy<br/>
Forth issued, brandishing his fatal dart,<br/>
Made to destroy. I fled, and cried out Death!<br/>
Hell trembled at the hideous name, and sighed<br/>
From all her caves, and back resounded Death!<br/>
I fled; but he pursued (though more, it seems,<br/>
Inflamed with lust than rage), and, swifter far,<br/>
Me overtook, his mother, all dismayed,<br/>
And, in embraces forcible and foul<br/>
Engendering with me, of that rape begot<br/>
These yelling monsters, that with ceaseless cry<br/>
Surround me, as thou saw'st-hourly conceived<br/>
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br/>
To me: for, when they list, into the womb<br/>
That bred them they return, and howl, and gnaw<br/>
My bowels, their repast; then, bursting forth<br/>
Afresh, with conscious terrors vex me round,<br/>
That rest or intermission none I find.<br/>
Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br/>
Grim Death, my son and foe, who sets them on,<br/>
And me, his parent, would full soon devour<br/>
For want of other prey, but that he knows<br/>
His end with mine involved, and knows that I<br/>
Should prove a bitter morsel, and his bane,<br/>
Whenever that shall be: so Fate pronounced.<br/>
But thou, O Father, I forewarn thee, shun<br/>
His deadly arrow: neither vainly hope<br/>
To be invulnerable in those bright arms,<br/>
Though tempered heavenly; for that mortal dint,<br/>
Save He who reigns above, none can resist."

She finished; and the subtle Fiend his lore<br/>
Soon learned, now milder, and thus answered smooth:—

"Dear daughter-since thou claim'st me for thy sire,<br/>
And my fair son here show'st me, the dear pledge<br/>
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven, and joys<br/>
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br/>
Befallen us unforeseen, unthought-of-know,<br/>
I come no enemy, but to set free<br/>
From out this dark and dismal house of pain<br/>
Both him and thee, and all the Heavenly host<br/>
Of Spirits that, in our just pretences armed,<br/>
Fell with us from on high. From them I go<br/>
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br/>
Myself expose, with lonely steps to tread<br/>
The unfounded Deep, and through the void immense<br/>
To search, with wandering quest, a place foretold<br/>
Should be-and, by concurring signs, ere now<br/>
Created vast and round-a place of bliss<br/>
In the pourlieues of Heaven; and therein placed<br/>
A race of upstart creatures, to supply<br/>
Perhaps our vacant room, though more removed,<br/>
Lest Heaven, surcharged with potent multitude,<br/>
Might hap to move new broils. Be this, or aught<br/>
Than this more secret, now designed, I haste<br/>
To know; and this once known, shall soon return<br/>
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death<br/>
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br/>
Wing silently the buxom air, imbalmed<br/>
With odours. There ye shall be fed and filled<br/>
Immeasurably; all things shall be your prey."

He ceased; for both seemed highly pleased, and Death<br/>
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile, to hear<br/>
His famine should be filled, and blessed his maw<br/>
Destined to that good hour. No less rejoiced<br/>
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire:—

"The key of this infernal Pit, by due<br/>
And by command of Heaven's all-powerful King,<br/>
I keep, by Him forbidden to unlock<br/>
These adamantine gates; against all force<br/>
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br/>
Fearless to be o'ermatched by living might.<br/>
But what I owe I to His commands above,<br/>
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br/>
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound,<br/>
To sit in hateful office here confined,<br/>
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly-born—<br/>
Here in perpetual agony and pain,<br/>
With terrors and with clamours compassed round<br/>
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed?<br/>
Thou art my father, thou my author, thou<br/>
My being gav'st me; whom should I obey<br/>
But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon<br/>
To that new world of light and bliss, among<br/>
The gods who live at ease, where I shall reign<br/>
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br/>
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end."

Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,<br/>
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br/>
And, toward the gate rowling her bestial train,<br/>
Forthwith the huge portcullis high up-drew,<br/>
Which, but herself, not all the Stygian Powers<br/>
Could once have moved; then in the keyhole turns<br/>
The intricate wards, and every bolt and bar<br/>
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease<br/>
Unfastens. On a sudden open fly,<br/>
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound,<br/>
The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate<br/>
Harsh thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br/>
Of Erebus. She opened; but to shut<br/>
Excelled her power: the gates wide open stood,<br/>
That with extended wings a bannered host,<br/>
Under spread ensigns marching, might pass through<br/>
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array;<br/>
So wide they stood, and like a furnace-mouth<br/>
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame.<br/>
Before their eyes in sudden view appear<br/>
The secrets of the hoary Deep-a dark<br/>
Illimitable ocean, without bound,<br/>
Without dimension: where length, breadth, and highth,<br/>
And time, and place, are lost; where eldest Night<br/>
And Chaos, ancestors of Nature, hold<br/>
Eternal anarchy, amidst the noise<br/>
Of endless wars, and by confusion stand.<br/>
For Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry, four champions fierce,<br/>
Strive here for maistrie, and to battle bring<br/>
Their embryon atoms: they around the flag<br/>
Of each his faction, in their several clans,<br/>
Light-armed or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift, or slow,<br/>
Swarm populous, unnumbered as the sands<br/>
Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil,<br/>
Levied to side with warring winds, and poise<br/>
Their lighter wings. To whom these most adhere<br/>
He rules a moment: Chaos umpire sits,<br/>
And by decision more imbroils the fray<br/>
By which he reigns: next him, high arbiter,<br/>
Chance governs all. Into this wild Abyss,<br/>
The womb of Nature, and perhaps her grave,<br/>
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,<br/>
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed<br/>
Confusedly, and which thus must ever fight,<br/>
Unless the Almighty Maker them ordain<br/>
His dark materials to create more worlds—<br/>
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend<br/>
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while,<br/>
Pondering his voyage; for no narrow frith<br/>
He had to cross. Nor was his ear less pealed<br/>
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br/>
Great things with small) than when Bellona storms<br/>
With all her battering engines, bent to rase<br/>
Some capital city; or less than if this frame<br/>
Of heaven were falling, and these elements<br/>
In mutiny had from her axle torn<br/>
The steadfast Earth. At last his sail-broad vans<br/>
He spreads for flight, and, in the surging smoke<br/>
Uplifted, spurns the ground; thence many a league,<br/>
As in a cloudy chair, ascending rides<br/>
Audacious; but, that seat soon failing, meets<br/>
A vast vacuity. All unawares,<br/>
Fluttering his pennons vain, plumb-down he drops<br/>
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour<br/>
Down had been falling, had not, by ill chance,<br/>
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud,<br/>
Instinct with fire and nitre, hurried him<br/>
As many miles aloft. That fury stayed—<br/>
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis, neither sea,<br/>
Nor good dry land-nigh foundered, on he fares,<br/>
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br/>
Half flying; behoves him now both oar and sail.<br/>
As when a gryfon through the wilderness<br/>
With winged course, o'er hill or moory dale,<br/>
Pursues the Arimpasian, who by stealth<br/>
Had from his wakeful custody purloined<br/>
The guarded gold; so eagerly the Fiend<br/>
O'er bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br/>
With head, hands, wings, or feet, pursues his way,<br/>
And swims, or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flies.<br/>
At length, a universal hubbub wild<br/>
Of stunning sounds, and voices all confused,<br/>
Borne through the hollow dark, assaults his ear<br/>
With loudest vehemence. Thither he plies<br/>
Undaunted, to meet there whatever Power<br/>
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br/>
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br/>
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies<br/>
Bordering on light; when straight behold the throne<br/>
Of Chaos, and his dark pavilion spread<br/>
Wide on the wasteful Deep! With him enthroned<br/>
Sat sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br/>
The consort of his reign; and by them stood<br/>
Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name<br/>
Of Demogorgon; Rumour next, and Chance,<br/>
And Tumult, and Confusion, all embroiled,<br/>
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.

To whom Satan, turning boldly, thus:—"Ye Powers<br/>
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,<br/>
Chaos and ancient Night, I come no spy<br/>
With purpose to explore or to disturb<br/>
The secrets of your realm; but, by constraint<br/>
Wandering this darksome desert, as my way<br/>
Lies through your spacious empire up to light,<br/>
Alone and without guide, half lost, I seek,<br/>
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds<br/>
Confine with Heaven; or, if some other place,<br/>
From your dominion won, the Ethereal King<br/>
Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br/>
I travel this profound. Direct my course;<br/>
Directed, no mean recompense it brings<br/>
To your behoof, if I that region lost.<br/>
All usurpation thence expelled, reduce<br/>
To her original darkness and your sway<br/>
(Which is my present journey), and once more<br/>
Erect the standard there of ancient Night.<br/>
Yours be the advantage all, mine the revenge!"

Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old,<br/>
With faltering speech and visage incomposed,<br/>
Answered:—"I know thee, stranger, who thou art—<br/>
That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br/>
Made head against Heaven's King, though overthrown.<br/>
I saw and heard; for such a numerous host<br/>
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep,<br/>
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br/>
Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates<br/>
Poured out by millions her victorious bands,<br/>
Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here<br/>
Keep residence; if all I can will serve<br/>
That little which is left so to defend,<br/>
Encroached on still through our intestine broils<br/>
Weakening the sceptre of old Night: first, Hell,<br/>
Your dungeon, stretching far and wide beneath;<br/>
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another world<br/>
Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain<br/>
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!<br/>
If that way be your walk, you have not far;<br/>
So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;<br/>
Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain."

He ceased; and Satan staid not to reply,<br/>
But, glad that now his sea should find a shore,<br/>
With fresh alacrity and force renewed<br/>
Springs upward, like a pyramid of fire,<br/>
Into the wild expanse, and through the shock<br/>
Of fighting elements, on all sides round<br/>
Environed, wins his way; harder beset<br/>
And more endangered than when Argo passed<br/>
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks,<br/>
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned<br/>
Charybdis, and by the other Whirlpool steered.<br/>
So he with difficulty and labour hard<br/>
Moved on. With difficulty and labour he;<br/>
But, he once passed, soon after, when Man fell,<br/>
Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain,<br/>
Following his track (such was the will of Heaven)<br/>
Paved after him a broad and beaten way<br/>
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling gulf<br/>
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length,<br/>
From Hell continued, reaching the utmost Orb<br/>
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br/>
With easy intercourse pass to and fro<br/>
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br/>
God and good Angels guard by special grace.

But now at last the sacred influence<br/>
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heaven<br/>
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night<br/>
A glimmering dawn. Here Nature first begins<br/>
Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire,<br/>
As from her utmost works, a broken foe,<br/>
With tumult less and with less hostile din;<br/>
That Satan with less toil, and now with ease,<br/>
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light,<br/>
And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds<br/>
Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn;<br/>
Or in the emptier waste, resembling air,<br/>
Weighs his spread wings, at leisure to behold<br/>
Far off the imperial Heaven, extended wide<br/>
In circuit, undetermined square or round,<br/>
With opal towers and battlements adorned<br/>
Of living sapphire, once his native seat,<br/>
And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,<br/>
This pendent World, in bigness as a star<br/>
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon.<br/>
Thither, full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br/>
Accurst, and in a cursed hour, he hies.

<h2>Book 3</h2>

Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heaven first-born!<br/>
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam<br/>
May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,<br/>
And never but in unapproached light<br/>
Dwelt from eternity-dwelt then in thee,<br/>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate!<br/>
Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal Stream,<br/>
Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the Sun,<br/>
Before the Heavens, thou wert, and at the voice<br/>
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest<br/>
The rising World of waters dark and deep,<br/>
Won from the void and formless Infinite!<br/>
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,<br/>
Escaped the Stygian Pool, though long detained<br/>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight,<br/>
Through utter and through middle Darkness borne,<br/>
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre<br/>
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night,<br/>
Taught by the Heavenly Muse to venture down<br/>
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,<br/>
Though hard and rare. Thee I revisit safe,<br/>
And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou<br/>
Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowl in vain<br/>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;<br/>
So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,<br/>
Or dim suffusion veiled. Yet not the more<br/>
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt<br/>
Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,<br/>
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief<br/>
Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,<br/>
That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,<br/>
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget<br/>
Those other two equalled with me in fate,<br/>
(So were I equalled with them in renown!)<br/>
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides,<br/>
And Tiresias and Phineus, prophets old:<br/>
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move<br/>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird<br/>
Sings darkling, and, in shadiest covert hid,<br/>
Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year<br/>
Seasons return; but not to me returns<br/>
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,<br/>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,<br/>
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;<br/>
But cloud instead and ever-during dark<br/>
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men<br/>
Cut off, and, for the book of knowledge fair,<br/>
Presented with a universal blank<br/>
Of Nature's works, to me expunged and rased,<br/>
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.<br/>
So much the rather thou, Celestial Light,<br/>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers<br/>
Irradiate; there plant eyes; all mist from thence<br/>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br/>
Of things invisible to mortal sight.

Now had the Almighty Father from above,<br/>
From the pure Empyrean where He sits<br/>
High throned above all highth, bent down his eye,<br/>
His own works and their works at once to view:<br/>
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven<br/>
Stood thick as stars, and from his sight received<br/>
Beatitude past utterance; on his right<br/>
The radiant image of his glory sat,<br/>
His only Son. On Earth he first beheld<br/>
Our two first parents, yet the only two<br/>
Of mankind, in the Happy Garden placed,<br/>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,<br/>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivalled love,<br/>
In blissful solitude. He then surveyed<br/>
Hell and the gulf between, and Satan there<br/>
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night,<br/>
In the dun air sublime, and ready now<br/>
To stoop, with wearied wings and willing feet,<br/>
On the bare outside of this World, that seemed<br/>
Firm land imbosomed without firmament,<br/>
Uncertain which, in ocean or in air.<br/>
Him God beholding from his prospect high,<br/>
Wherein past, present, future, he beholds,<br/>
Thus to His only Son foreseeing spake:—

"Only-begotten Son, seest thou what rage<br/>
Transports our Adversary? whom no bounds<br/>
Prescribed, no bars of Hell, nor all the chains<br/>
Heaped on him there, nor yet the main Abyss<br/>
Wide interrupt, can hold; so bent he seems<br/>
On desperate revenge, that shall redound<br/>
Upon his own rebellious head. And now,<br/>
Through all restraint broke loose, he wings his way<br/>
Not far off Heaven, in the precincts of light,<br/>
Directly towards the new-created World,<br/>
And Man there placed, with purpose to assay<br/>
If him by force he can destroy, or, worse,<br/>
By some false guile pervert: and shall pervert;<br/>
For Man will hearken to his glozing lies,<br/>
And easily transgress the sole command,<br/>
Sole pledge of his obedience: so will fall<br/>
He and his faithless progeny. Whose fault?<br/>
Whose but his own? Ingrate, he had of me<br/>
All he could have; I made him just and right,<br/>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.<br/>
Such I created all the Ethereal Powers<br/>
And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed;<br/>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.<br/>
Not free, what proof could they have given sincere<br/>
Of true allegiance, constant faith, or love,<br/>
Where only what they needs must do appeared,<br/>
Not what they would? What praise could they receive,<br/>
What pleasure I, from such obedience paid.<br/>
When Will and Reason (Reason also is Choice),<br/>
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled,<br/>
Made passive both, had served Necessity,<br/>
Not Me? They, therefore, as to right belonged<br/>
So were created, nor can justly accuse<br/>
Their Maker, or their making, or their fate,<br/>
As if Predestination overruled<br/>
Their will, disposed by absolute decree<br/>
Or high foreknowledge. They themselves decreed<br/>
Their own revolt, not I. If I foreknew,<br/>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br/>
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown.<br/>
So without least impulse or shadow of fate,<br/>
Or aught by me immutably foreseen,<br/>
They trespass, authors to themselves in all,<br/>
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so<br/>
I formed them free, and free they must remain<br/>
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change<br/>
Their nature, and revoke the high decree<br/>
Unchangeable, eternal, which ordained<br/>
Their freedom; they themselves ordained their fall.<br/>
The first sort by their own suggestion fell,<br/>
Self-tempted, self-depraved; Man falls, deceived<br/>
By the other first: Man, therefore, shall find grace;<br/>
The other, none. In mercy and justice both,<br/>
Through Heaven and Earth, so shall my glory excel;<br/>
But mercy, first and last, shall brightest shine."

Thus while God spake ambrosial fragrance filled<br/>
All Heaven, and in the blessed Spirits elect<br/>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffused.<br/>
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen<br/>
Most glorious; in him all his Father shon<br/>
Substantially expressed; and in his face<br/>
Divine compassion visibly appeared,<br/>
Love without end, and without measure grace;<br/>
Which uttering, thus He to his Father spake; -

"O Father, gracious was that word which closed<br/>
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;<br/>
For which both Heaven and Earth shall high extol<br/>
Thy praises, with the innumerable sound<br/>
Of hymns and sacred songs, wherewith thy throne<br/>
Encompassed shall resound thee ever blest.<br/>
For, should Man finally be lost-should Man,<br/>
Thy creature late so loved, thy youngest son,<br/>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joined<br/>
With his own folly -! That be from thee far,<br/>
That far be from thee, Father, who art judge<br/>
Of all things made, and judgest only right!<br/>
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain<br/>
His end, and frustrate thine? Shall he fulfil<br/>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught<br/>
Or proud return, though to his heavier doom<br/>
Yet with revenge accomplished, and to Hell<br/>
Draw after him the whole race of mankind,<br/>
By him corrupted? Or wilt thou thyself<br/>
Abolish thy creation, and unmake,<br/>
For him, what for thy glory thou hast made?—<br/>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both<br/>
Be questioned and blasphemed without defense."

To whom the great Creator thus replied:—<br/>
"O Son, in whom my soul hath chief delight,<br/>
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone<br/>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,<br/>
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all<br/>
As my eternal purpose hath decreed.<br/>
Man shall not quite be lost, but saved who will;<br/>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me<br/>
Freely voutsafed. Once more I will renew<br/>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit, and enthralled<br/>
By sin to foul exorbitant desires:<br/>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand<br/>
On even ground against his mortal foe—<br/>
By me upheld, that he may know how frail<br/>
His fallen condition is, and to me owe<br/>
All his deliverance, and to none but me.<br/>
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace,<br/>
Elect above the rest; so is my will:<br/>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warned<br/>
Their sinful state, and to appease betimes<br/>
The incensed Deity, while offered grace<br/>
Invites; for I will clear their senses dark<br/>
What may suffice, and soften stony hearts<br/>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.<br/>
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,<br/>
Though but endeavoured with sincere intent,<br/>
Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.<br/>
And I will place within them as a guide<br/>
My umpire Conscience; whom if they will hear,<br/>
Light after light well used they shall attain,<br/>
And to the end persisting safe arrive.<br/>
This my long sufferance, and my day of grace,<br/>
They who neglect and scorn shall never taste;<br/>
But hard be hardened, blind be blinded more,<br/>
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;<br/>
And none but such from mercy I exclude.—<br/>
But yet all is not done. Man disobeying,<br/>
Disloyal, breaks his fealty, and sins<br/>
Against the high supremacy of Heaven,<br/>
Affecting Godhead, and, so losing all,<br/>
To expiate his treason hath naught left,<br/>
But, to destruction sacred and devote,<br/>
He with his whole posterity must die;<br/>
Die he or Justice must; unless for him<br/>
Some other, able, and as willing, pay<br/>
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br/>
Say, Heavenly Powers, where shall we find such love?<br/>
Which of ye will be mortal, to redeem<br/>
Man's mortal crime, and just, the unjust to save?<br/>
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?"

He asked, but all the Heavenly Quire stood mute,<br/>
And silence was in Heaven: on Man's behalf<br/>
Patron or intercessor none appeared—<br/>
Much less that durst upon his own head draw<br/>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.<br/>
And now without redemption all mankind<br/>
Must have been lost, adjudged to Death and Hell<br/>
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,<br/>
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,<br/>
His dearest mediation thus renewed:—

"Father, thy word is passed, Man shall find grace;<br/>
And shall Grace not find means, that finds her way,<br/>
The speediest of thy winged messengers,<br/>
To visit all thy creatures, and to all<br/>
Comes unprevented, unimplored, unsought?<br/>
Happy for Man, so coming! He her aid<br/>
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost—<br/>
Atonement for himself, or offering meet,<br/>
Indebted and undone, hath none to bring.<br/>
Behold me, then: me for him, life for life,<br/>
I offer; on me let thine anger fall;<br/>
Account me Man: I for his sake will leave<br/>
Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee<br/>
Freely put off, and for him lastly die<br/>
Well pleased; on me let Death wreak all his rage.<br/>
Under his gloomy power I shall not long<br/>
Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess<br/>
Life in myself for ever; by thee I live;<br/>
Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,<br/>
All that of men can die, yet, that debt paid,<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave<br/>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted soul<br/>
For ever with corruption there to dwell;<br/>
But I shall rise victorious, and subdue<br/>
My vanquisher, spoiled of his vaunted spoil.<br/>
Death his death's wound shall then receive, and stoop<br/>
Inglorious, of his mortal sting disarmed;<br/>
I through the ample air in triumph high<br/>
Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell, and show<br/>
The powers of Darkness bound. Thou, at the sight<br/>
Pleased, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,<br/>
While, by thee raised, I ruin all my foes—<br/>
Death last, and with his carcase glut the grave;<br/>
Then, with the multitude of my redeemed,<br/>
Shall enter Heaven, long absent, and return,<br/>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud<br/>
Of anger shall remain, but peace assured<br/>
And reconcilement: wrauth shall be no more<br/>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire."

His words here ended; but his meek aspect'<br/>
Silent yet spake, and breathed immortal love<br/>
To mortal man, above which only shon<br/>
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice<br/>
Glad to be offered, he attends the will<br/>
Of his great Father. Admiration seized<br/>
All Heaven, what this might mean, and whither tend,<br/>
Wondering; but soon the Almighty thus replied:—

"O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace<br/>
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou<br/>
My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear<br/>
To me are all my works; nor Man the least,<br/>
Though last created, that for him I spare<br/>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,<br/>
By losing thee a while, the whole race lost!<br/>
Thou, therefore, whom thou only canst redeem,<br/>
Their nature also to thy nature join;<br/>
And be thyself Man among men on Earth,<br/>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of virgin seed,<br/>
By wondrous birth; be thou in Adam's room<br/>
The head of all mankind, though Adam's son.<br/>
As in him perish all men, so in thee,<br/>
As from a second root, shall be restored<br/>
As many as are restored; without thee, none.<br/>
His crime makes guilty all his sons; thy merit,<br/>
Imputed, shall absolve them who renounce<br/>
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,<br/>
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee<br/>
Receive new life, So Man, as is most just,<br/>
Shall satisfy for Man, be judged and die,<br/>
And dying rise, and, rising, with him raise<br/>
His brethren, ransomed with his own dear life.<br/>
So Heavenly love shall outdo Hellish hate,<br/>
Giving to death, and dying to redeem,<br/>
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate<br/>
So easily destroyed, and still destroys<br/>
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.<br/>
Nor shalt thou, by descending to assume<br/>
Man's nature, lessen or degrade thine own.<br/>
Because thou hast, though throned in highest bliss<br/>
Equal to God, and equally enjoying<br/>
God-like fruition, quitted all to save<br/>
A world from utter loss, and hast been found<br/>
By merit more than birthright Son of God,—<br/>
Found worthiest to be so by being good,<br/>
Far more than great or high; because in thee<br/>
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds;<br/>
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt<br/>
With thee thy manhood also to this Throne:<br/>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt reign<br/>
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,<br/>
Anointed universal King. All power<br/>
I give thee; reign for ever, and assume<br/>
Thy merits; under thee, as Head Supreme,<br/>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions, I reduce:<br/>
All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide<br/>
In Heaven, or Earth, or, under Earth, in Hell.<br/>
When thou, attended gloriously from Heaven,<br/>
Shalt in the sky appear, and from thee send<br/>
The summoning Archangels to proclaim<br/>
Thy dread tribunal, forthwith from all winds<br/>
The living, and forthwith the cited dead<br/>
Of all past ages, to the general doom<br/>
Shall hasten; such a peal shall rouse their sleep.<br/>
Then, all thy Saints assembled, thou shalt judge<br/>
Bad men and Angels; they arraigned shall sink<br/>
Beneath thy sentence; Hell, her numbers full,<br/>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Meanwhile<br/>
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring<br/>
New Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell,<br/>
And, after all their tribulations long,<br/>
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,<br/>
With Joy and Love triumph'ing, and fair Truth.<br/>
Then thou thy regal sceptre shalt lay by;<br/>
For regal sceptre then no more shall need;<br/>
God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods,<br/>
Adore Him who, to compass all this, dies;<br/>
Adore the Son, and honour him as me."

No sooner had the Almighty ceased but-all<br/>
The multitude of Angels, with a shout<br/>
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<br/>
As from blest voices, uttering joy-Heaven rung<br/>
With jubilee, and loud Hosannas filled<br/>
The eternal regions. Lowly reverent<br/>
Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground<br/>
With solemn adoration down they cast<br/>
Their crowns, inwove with amarant and gold,—<br/>
Immortal amarant, a flower which once<br/>
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life,<br/>
Began to bloom, but, soon for Man's offence<br/>
To Heaven removed where first it grew, there grows<br/>
And flowers aloft, shading the Fount of Life,<br/>
And where the River of Bliss through midst of Heaven<br/>
Rowls o'er Elysian flowers her amber stream!<br/>
With these, that never fade, the Spirits elect<br/>
Bind their resplendent locks, inwreathed with beams.<br/>
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright<br/>
Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shon,<br/>
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.<br/>
Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took—<br/>
Harps ever tuned, that glittering by their side<br/>
Like quivers hung; and with preamble sweet<br/>
Of charming symphony they introduce<br/>
Their sacred song, and waken raptures high:<br/>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join<br/>
Melodious part; such concord is in Heaven.

Thee, Father, first they sung, Omnipotent<br/>
Immutable, Immortal. Infinite,<br/>
Eternal King; thee, Author of all being,<br/>
Fountain of light, thyself invisible<br/>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitt'st<br/>
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shad'st<br/>
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud<br/>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine<br/>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,<br/>
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim<br/>
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.<br/>
Thee next they sang, of all creation first,<br/>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,<br/>
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud<br/>
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,<br/>
Whom else no creature can behold: on thee<br/>
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides;<br/>
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests.<br/>
He Heaven of Heavens, and all the Powers therein,<br/>
By thee created; and by thee threw down<br/>
The aspiring Dominations. Thou that day<br/>
Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,<br/>
Nor stop thy flaming chariot-wheels, that shook<br/>
Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks<br/>
Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarrayed.<br/>
Back from pursuit, thy Powers with loud acclaim<br/>
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,<br/>
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes.<br/>
Not so on Man: him, through their malice fallen,<br/>
Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pity encline.<br/>
No sooner did thy dear and only Son<br/>
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pity enclined,<br/>
He, to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife<br/>
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,<br/>
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat<br/>
Second to thee, offered himself to die<br/>
For Man's offence. O unexampled love!<br/>
Love nowhere to be found less than Divine!<br/>
Hail, Son of God, Saviour of men! Thy name<br/>
Shall be the copious matter of my song<br/>
Henceforth, and never shall my harp thy praise<br/>
Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin!

Thus they in Heaven, above the Starry Sphere,<br/>
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent.<br/>
Meanwhile, upon the firm opacous globe<br/>
Of this round World, whose first convex divides<br/>
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclosed<br/>
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old,<br/>
Satan alighted walks. A globe far off<br/>
It seemed; now seems a boundless continent,<br/>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night<br/>
Starless exposed, and ever-threatening storms<br/>
Of Chaos blustering round, inclement sky,<br/>
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven,<br/>
Though distant far, some small reflection gains<br/>
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud.<br/>
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field.<br/>
As when a vultur, on Imaus bred,<br/>
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds,<br/>
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey,<br/>
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yearling kids<br/>
On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs<br/>
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams,<br/>
But in his way lights on the barren plains<br/>
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive<br/>
With sails and wind their cany waggons light;<br/>
So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend<br/>
Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey:<br/>
Alone, for other creature in this place,<br/>
Living or lifeless, to be found was none:—<br/>
None yet; but store hereafter from the Earth<br/>
Up hither like aerial vapours flew<br/>
Of all things transitory and vain, when sin<br/>
With vanity had filled the works of men—<br/>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things<br/>
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame,<br/>
Or happiness in this or the other life.<br/>
All who have their reward on earth, the fruits<br/>
Of painful superstition and blind zeal,<br/>
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find<br/>
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds;<br/>
All the unaccomplished works of Nature's hand,<br/>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,<br/>
Dissolved on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain,<br/>
Till final dissolution, wander here—<br/>
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamed:<br/>
Those argent fields more likely habitants,<br/>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold,<br/>
Betwixt the angelical and human kind.<br/>
Hither, of ill-joined sons and daughters born,<br/>
First from the ancient world those Giants came,<br/>
With many a vain exploit, though then renowned:<br/>
The builders next of Babel on the plain<br/>
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design<br/>
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:<br/>
Others came single; he who, to be deemed<br/>
A god, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,<br/>
Empedocles; and he who, to enjoy<br/>
Plato's Elysium, leaped into the sea,<br/>
Cleombrotus; and many more, too long,<br/>
Embryos and idiots, eremites and friars,<br/>
White, black, and grey, with all their trumpery.<br/>
Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek<br/>
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven;<br/>
And they who, to be sure of Paradise,<br/>
Dying put on the weeds of Dominic,<br/>
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised.<br/>
They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,<br/>
And that crystal'lin sphere whose balance weighs<br/>
The trepidation talked, and that first moved;<br/>
And now Saint Peter at Heaven's wicket seems<br/>
To wait them with his keys, and now at foot<br/>
Of Heaven's ascent they lift their feet, when, lo!<br/>
A violent cross wind from either coast<br/>
Blows them transverse, then thousand leagues awry,<br/>
Into the devious air. Then might ye see<br/>
Cowls, hoods, and habits, with their wearers, tost<br/>
And fluttered into rags; then reliques, beads,<br/>
Indulgences, dispenses, pardons, bulls<br/>
The sport of winds: all these, upwhirled aloft,<br/>
Fly o'er the backside of the World far off<br/>
Into a Limbo large and broad, since called<br/>
The Paradise of Fools; to few unknown<br/>
Long after, now unpeopled and untrod.

All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed;<br/>
And long he wandered, till at last a gleam<br/>
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste<br/>
His travelled steps. Far distant he descries,<br/>
Ascending by degrees magnificent<br/>
Up to the wall of Heaven, a structure high;<br/>
At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared<br/>
The work as of a kingly palace-gate,<br/>
With frontispiece of diamond and gold<br/>
Imbellished; thick with sparkling orient gems<br/>
The portal shon, inimitable on Earth<br/>
By model, or by shading pencil drawn.<br/>
The stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw<br/>
Angels ascending and descending, bands<br/>
Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled<br/>
To Padan-Aram, in the field of Luz<br/>
Dreaming by night under the open sky,<br/>
And waking cried, This is the gate of Heaven.<br/>
Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br/>
There always, but drawn up to Heaven sometimes<br/>
Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed<br/>
Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon<br/>
Who after came from Earth sailing arrived<br/>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o'er the lake<br/>
Rapt is a chariot drawn by fiery steeds.<br/>
The stairs were then let down, whether to dare<br/>
The Fiend by easy ascent, or aggravate<br/>
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss:<br/>
Direct against which opened from beneath,<br/>
Just o'er the blissful seat of Paradise,<br/>
A passage down to the Earth-a passage wide;<br/>
Wider by far than that of after-times<br/>
Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large,<br/>
Over the Promised Land to God so dear,<br/>
By which, to visit oft those happy tribes,<br/>
On high behests his Angels to and fro<br/>
Passed frequent, and his eye with choice regard<br/>
From Paneas, the fount of Jordan's flood,<br/>
To Beersaba, where the Holy Land<br/>
Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shore.<br/>
So wide the opening seemed, where bounds were set<br/>
To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.<br/>
Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,<br/>
That scaled by steps of gold to Heaven-gate,<br/>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view<br/>
Of all this World at once. As when a scout,<br/>
Through dark and desart ways with peril gone<br/>
All night, at last by break of cheerful dawn<br/>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing hill,<br/>
Which to his eye discovers unaware<br/>
The goodly prospect of some foreign land<br/>
First seen, or some renowned metropolis<br/>
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,<br/>
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams;<br/>
Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,<br/>
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized,<br/>
At sight of all this World beheld so fair.<br/>
Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood<br/>
So high above the circling canopy<br/>
Of Night's extended shade) from eastern point<br/>
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears<br/>
Andromeda far off Atlantic seas<br/>
Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole<br/>
He views in breadth,-and, without longer pause,<br/>
Down right into the World's first region throws<br/>
His flight precipitant, and winds with ease<br/>
Through the pure marble air his oblique way<br/>
Amongst innumerable stars, that shon<br/>
Stars distant, but nigh-hand seemed other worlds.<br/>
Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,<br/>
Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,<br/>
Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales;<br/>
Thrice happy isles! But who dwelt happy there<br/>
He staid not to inquire: above them all<br/>
The golden Sun, in splendour likest Heaven,<br/>
Allured his eye. Thither his course he bends,<br/>
Through the calm firmament (but up or down,<br/>
By centre or eccentric, hard to tell,<br/>
Or longitude) where the great luminary,<br/>
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,<br/>
That from the lordly eye keep distance due,<br/>
Dispenses light from far. They, as they move<br/>
Their starry dance in numbers that compute<br/>
Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp<br/>
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned<br/>
By his magnetic beam, that gently warms<br/>
The Universe, and to each inward part<br/>
With gentle penetration, though unseen<br/>
Shoots invisible virtue even to the Deep;<br/>
So wondrously was set his station bright.<br/>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps<br/>
Astronomer in the Sun's lucent orb<br/>
Through his glazed optic tube yet never saw.<br/>
The place he found beyond expression bright,<br/>
Compared with aught on Earth, metal or stone—<br/>
Not all parts like, but all alike informed<br/>
With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire.<br/>
If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;<br/>
If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,<br/>
Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shon<br/>
In Aaron's breast-plate, and a stone besides;<br/>
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen—<br/>
That stone, or like to that, which there below<br/>
Philosophers in vain so long have sought;<br/>
In vain, though by their powerful art they bind<br/>
Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound<br/>
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,<br/>
Drained through a limbec to his native form.<br/>
What wonder then if fields and regions here<br/>
Breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run<br/>
Potable gold, when, with one virtuous touch,<br/>
The arch-chimic Sun, so far from us remote,<br/>
Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,<br/>
Here in the dark so many precious things<br/>
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?<br/>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met<br/>
Undazzled. Far and wide his eye commands;<br/>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,<br/>
But all sunshine, as when his beams at noon<br/>
Culminate from the equator, as they now<br/>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round<br/>
Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,<br/>
Nowhere so clear, sharpened his visual ray<br/>
To objects distant far, whereby he soon<br/>
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand,<br/>
The same whom John saw also in the Sun.<br/>
His back was turned, but not his brightness hid;<br/>
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar<br/>
Circled his head, nor less his locks behind<br/>
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings<br/>
Lay waving round: on some great charge imployed<br/>
He seemed, or fixed in cogitation deep.<br/>
Glad was the Spirit impure, as now in hope<br/>
To find who might direct his wandering flight<br/>
To Paradise, the happy seat of Man,<br/>
His journey's end, and our beginning woe.<br/>
But first he casts to change his proper shape,<br/>
Which else might work him danger or delay:<br/>
And now a stripling Cherub he appears,<br/>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face<br/>
Youth smiled celestial, and to every limb<br/>
Suitable grace diffused; so well he feigned.<br/>
Under a coronet his flowing hair<br/>
In curls on either cheek played; wings he wore<br/>
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold;<br/>
His habit fit for speed succinct; and held<br/>
Before his decent steps a silver wand.<br/>
He drew not nigh unheard; the Angel bright,<br/>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turned,<br/>
Admonished by his ear, and straight was known<br/>
The Archangel Uriel-one of the seven<br/>
Who in God's presence, nearest to his throne,<br/>
Stand ready at command, and are his eyes<br/>
That run through all the Heavens, or down to the<br/>
Earth<br/>
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,<br/>
O'er sea and land. Him Satan thus accosts:—

"Uriel! for thou of those seven Spirits that stand<br/>
In sight of God's high throne, gloriously bright,<br/>
The first art wont his great authentic will<br/>
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring,<br/>
Where all his Sons thy embassy attend,<br/>
And here art likeliest by supreme decree<br/>
Like honour to obtain, and as his eye<br/>
To visit oft this new Creation round—<br/>
Unspeakable desire to see and know<br/>
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man<br/>
His chief delight and favour, him for whom<br/>
All these his works so wondrous he ordained,<br/>
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim<br/>
Alone thus wandering. Brightest Seraph, tell<br/>
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man<br/>
His fixed seat-or fixed seat hath none,<br/>
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell—<br/>
That I may find him, and with secret gaze<br/>
Or open admiration him behold<br/>
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed<br/>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured;<br/>
That both in him and all things, as is meet,<br/>
The Universal Maker we may praise;<br/>
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes<br/>
To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,<br/>
Created this new happy race of Men<br/>
To serve him better. Wise are all his ways!"

So spake the false dissembler unperceived;<br/>
For neither man nor angel can discern<br/>
Hypocrisy-the only evil that walks<br/>
Invisible, except to God alone,<br/>
By his permissive will, through Heaven and Earth;<br/>
And oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps<br/>
At Wisdom's gate, and to Simplicity<br/>
Resigns her charge, while Goodness thinks no ill<br/>
Where no ill seems: which now for once beguiled<br/>
Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held<br/>
The sharpest-sighted Spirit of all in Heaven;<br/>
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul,<br/>
In his uprightness, answer thus returned:—

"Fair Angel, thy desire, which tends to know<br/>
The works of God, thereby to glorify<br/>
The great Work-master, leads to no excess<br/>
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise<br/>
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither<br/>
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone,<br/>
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps,<br/>
Contented with report, hear only in Heaven:<br/>
For wonderful indeed are all his works,<br/>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all<br/>
Had in remembrance always with delight!<br/>
But what created mind can comprehend<br/>
Their number, or the wisdom infinite<br/>
That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?<br/>
I saw when, at his word, the formless mass,<br/>
This World's material mould, came to a heap:<br/>
Confusion heard his voice, and wild Uproar<br/>
Stood ruled, stood vast Infinitude confined;<br/>
Till, at his second bidding, Darkness fled,<br/>
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung.<br/>
Swift to their several quarters hasted then<br/>
The cumbrous elements-Earth, Flood, Air, Fire;<br/>
And this ethereal quint' essence of Heaven<br/>
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br/>
That rowled orbicular, and turned to stars<br/>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move:<br/>
Each had his place appointed, each his course;<br/>
The rest in circuit walls this Universe.<br/>
Look downward on that globe, whose hither side<br/>
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines:<br/>
That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light<br/>
His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,<br/>
Night would invade; but there the neighbouring Moon<br/>
(So called that opposite fair star) her aid<br/>
Timely interposes, and, her monthly round<br/>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid-heaven,<br/>
With borrowed light her countenance triform<br/>
Hence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth,<br/>
And in her pale dominion checks the night.<br/>
That spot to which I point is Paradise,<br/>
Adam's abode; those lofty shades his bower.<br/>
Thy way thou canst not miss; me mine requires."

Thus said, he turned; and Satan, bowing low,<br/>
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,<br/>
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,<br/>
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,<br/>
Down from the ecliptic, sped with hoped success,<br/>
Throws his steep flight in many an aerie wheel,<br/>
Nor staid till on Niphates' top he lights.

<h2>Book 4</h2>

O For that warning voice, which he who saw<br/>
Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br/>
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br/>
Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,<br/>
WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now,<br/>
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd<br/>
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd<br/>
Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now<br/>
SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,<br/>
The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,<br/>
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss<br/>
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:<br/>
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,<br/>
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br/>
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth<br/>
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,<br/>
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles<br/>
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract<br/>
His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr<br/>
The Hell within him, for within him Hell<br/>
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br/>
One step no more then from himself can fly<br/>
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair<br/>
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie<br/>
Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br/>
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br/>
Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view<br/>
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,<br/>
Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,<br/>
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:<br/>
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.

O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,<br/>
Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God<br/>
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs<br/>
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,<br/>
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name<br/>
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams<br/>
That bring to my remembrance from what state<br/>
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;<br/>
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down<br/>
Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:<br/>
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return<br/>
From me, whom he created what I was<br/>
In that bright eminence, and with his good<br/>
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br/>
What could be less then to afford him praise,<br/>
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,<br/>
How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,<br/>
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high<br/>
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher<br/>
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/>
The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/>
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;<br/>
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,<br/>
And understood not that a grateful mind<br/>
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br/>
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?<br/>
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind<br/>
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood<br/>
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd<br/>
Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power<br/>
As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean<br/>
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great<br/>
Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within<br/>
Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.<br/>
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?<br/>
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/>
But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?<br/>
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,<br/>
To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/>
Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will<br/>
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/>
Me miserable! which way shall I flie<br/>
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?<br/>
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;<br/>
And in the lowest deep a lower deep<br/>
Still threatning to devour me opens wide,<br/>
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.<br/>
O then at last relent: is there no place<br/>
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?<br/>
None left but by submission; and that word<br/>
DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame<br/>
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd<br/>
With other promises and other vaunts<br/>
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue<br/>
Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know<br/>
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,<br/>
Under what torments inwardly I groane;<br/>
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,<br/>
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd<br/>
The lower still I fall, onely Supream<br/>
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.<br/>
But say I could repent and could obtaine<br/>
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon<br/>
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay<br/>
What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant<br/>
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.<br/>
For never can true reconcilement grow<br/>
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep:<br/>
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br/>
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare<br/>
Short intermission bought with double smart.<br/>
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr<br/>
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:<br/>
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead<br/>
Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,<br/>
Mankind created, and for him this World.<br/>
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,<br/>
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;<br/>
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least<br/>
Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold<br/>
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;<br/>
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.

Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face<br/>
Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair,<br/>
Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid<br/>
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.<br/>
For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule<br/>
Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware,<br/>
Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme,<br/>
Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br/>
That practisd falshood under saintly shew,<br/>
Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge:<br/>
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive<br/>
URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down<br/>
The way he went, and on th' ASSYRIAN mount<br/>
Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall<br/>
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce<br/>
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,<br/>
As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen.<br/>
So on he fares, and to the border comes<br/>
Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise,<br/>
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,<br/>
As with a rural mound the champain head<br/>
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides<br/>
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,<br/>
Access deni'd; and over head up grew<br/>
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,<br/>
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,<br/>
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend<br/>
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre<br/>
Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops<br/>
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:<br/>
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large<br/>
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.<br/>
And higher then that Wall a circling row<br/>
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,<br/>
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue<br/>
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:<br/>
On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams<br/>
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,<br/>
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd<br/>
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire<br/>
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br/>
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br/>
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales<br/>
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense<br/>
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br/>
Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile<br/>
Beyond the CAPE OF HOPE, and now are past<br/>
MOZAMBIC, off at Sea North-East windes blow<br/>
SABEAN Odours from the spicie shoare<br/>
Of ARABIE the blest, with such delay<br/>
Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League<br/>
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.<br/>
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend<br/>
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd<br/>
Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume,<br/>
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse<br/>
Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent<br/>
From MEDIA post to AEGYPT, there fast bound.

Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill<br/>
SATAN had journied on, pensive and slow;<br/>
But further way found none, so thick entwin'd,<br/>
As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth<br/>
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext<br/>
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:<br/>
One Gate there onely was, and that look'd East<br/>
On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw<br/>
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,<br/>
At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound<br/>
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within<br/>
Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe,<br/>
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br/>
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve<br/>
In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,<br/>
Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:<br/>
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash<br/>
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,<br/>
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br/>
In at the window climbes, or o're the tiles;<br/>
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:<br/>
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.<br/>
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,<br/>
The middle Tree and highest there that grew,<br/>
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life<br/>
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death<br/>
To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought<br/>
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd<br/>
For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge<br/>
Of immortalitie. So little knows<br/>
Any, but God alone, to value right<br/>
The good before him, but perverts best things<br/>
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.<br/>
Beneath him with new wonder now he views<br/>
To all delight of human sense expos'd<br/>
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,<br/>
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise<br/>
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East<br/>
Of EDEN planted; EDEN stretchd her Line<br/>
From AURAN Eastward to the Royal Towrs<br/>
Of great SELEUCIA, built by GRECIAN Kings,<br/>
Or where the Sons of EDEN long before<br/>
Dwelt in TELASSAR: in this pleasant soile<br/>
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;<br/>
Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow<br/>
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br/>
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,<br/>
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit<br/>
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life<br/>
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,<br/>
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.<br/>
Southward through EDEN went a River large,<br/>
Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill<br/>
Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown<br/>
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd<br/>
Upon the rapid current, which through veins<br/>
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,<br/>
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill<br/>
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell<br/>
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,<br/>
Which from his darksom passage now appeers,<br/>
And now divided into four main Streams,<br/>
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme<br/>
And Country whereof here needs no account,<br/>
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,<br/>
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,<br/>
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,<br/>
With mazie error under pendant shades<br/>
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br/>
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art<br/>
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon<br/>
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,<br/>
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote<br/>
The open field, and where the unpierc't shade<br/>
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,<br/>
A happy rural seat of various view;<br/>
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,<br/>
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde<br/>
Hung amiable, HESPERIAN Fables true,<br/>
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:<br/>
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks<br/>
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd,<br/>
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap<br/>
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,<br/>
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:<br/>
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves<br/>
Of coole recess, o're which the mantling Vine<br/>
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps<br/>
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall<br/>
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,<br/>
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,<br/>
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.<br/>
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,<br/>
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br/>
The trembling leaves, while Universal PAN<br/>
Knit with the GRACES and the HOURS in dance<br/>
Led on th' Eternal Spring. Not that faire field<br/>
Of ENNA, where PROSERPIN gathring flours<br/>
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie DIS<br/>
Was gatherd, which cost CERES all that pain<br/>
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove<br/>
Of DAPHNE by ORONTES, and th' inspir'd<br/>
CASTALIAN Spring might with this Paradise<br/>
Of EDEN strive; nor that NYSEIAN Ile<br/>
Girt with the River TRITON, where old CHAM,<br/>
Whom Gentiles AMMON call and LIBYAN JOVE,<br/>
Hid AMALTHEA and her Florid Son<br/>
Young BACCHUS from his Stepdame RHEA'S eye;<br/>
Nor where ABASSIN Kings thir issue Guard,<br/>
Mount AMARA, though this by som suppos'd<br/>
True Paradise under the ETHIOP Line<br/>
By NILUS head, enclos'd with shining Rock,<br/>
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote<br/>
From this ASSYRIAN Garden, where the Fiend<br/>
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind<br/>
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:<br/>
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,<br/>
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad<br/>
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,<br/>
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine<br/>
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,<br/>
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,<br/>
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't;<br/>
Whence true autoritie in men; though both<br/>
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;<br/>
For contemplation hee and valour formd,<br/>
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,<br/>
Hee for God only, shee for God in him:<br/>
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd<br/>
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks<br/>
Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br/>
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br/>
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste<br/>
Her unadorned golden tresses wore<br/>
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd<br/>
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd<br/>
Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,<br/>
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,<br/>
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,<br/>
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.<br/>
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,<br/>
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame<br/>
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,<br/>
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind<br/>
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,<br/>
And banisht from mans life his happiest life,<br/>
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.<br/>
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight<br/>
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:<br/>
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair<br/>
That ever since in loves imbraces met,<br/>
ADAM the goodliest man of men since borne<br/>
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters EVE.<br/>
Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br/>
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side<br/>
They sat them down, and after no more toil<br/>
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd<br/>
To recommend coole ZEPHYR, and made ease<br/>
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite<br/>
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,<br/>
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes<br/>
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline<br/>
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:<br/>
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde<br/>
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;<br/>
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br/>
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems<br/>
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,<br/>
Alone as they. About them frisking playd<br/>
All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase<br/>
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;<br/>
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw<br/>
Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards<br/>
Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant<br/>
To make them mirth us'd all his might, & wreathd<br/>
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly<br/>
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br/>
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile<br/>
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass<br/>
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,<br/>
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun<br/>
Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer<br/>
To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale<br/>
Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:<br/>
When SATAN still in gaze, as first he stood,<br/>
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.

O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,<br/>
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't<br/>
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,<br/>
Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright<br/>
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue<br/>
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines<br/>
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace<br/>
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.<br/>
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh<br/>
Your change approaches, when all these delights<br/>
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,<br/>
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;<br/>
Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd<br/>
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n<br/>
Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe<br/>
As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe<br/>
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne<br/>
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,<br/>
And mutual amitie so streight, so close,<br/>
That I with you must dwell, or you with me<br/>
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please<br/>
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such<br/>
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,<br/>
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,<br/>
To entertain you two, her widest Gates,<br/>
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,<br/>
Not like these narrow limits, to receive<br/>
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,<br/>
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge<br/>
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.<br/>
And should I at your harmless innocence<br/>
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,<br/>
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd,<br/>
By conquering this new World, compels me now<br/>
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.

So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,<br/>
The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.<br/>
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree<br/>
Down he alights among the sportful Herd<br/>
Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,<br/>
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end<br/>
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd<br/>
To mark what of thir state he more might learn<br/>
By word or action markt: about them round<br/>
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,<br/>
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd<br/>
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,<br/>
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft<br/>
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground<br/>
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both<br/>
Grip't in each paw: when ADAM first of men<br/>
To first of women EVE thus moving speech,<br/>
Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,<br/>
Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power<br/>
That made us, and for us this ample World<br/>
Be infinitly good, and of his good<br/>
As liberal and free as infinite,<br/>
That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here<br/>
In all this happiness, who at his hand<br/>
Have nothing merited, nor can performe<br/>
Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires<br/>
From us no other service then to keep<br/>
This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees<br/>
In Paradise that beare delicious fruit<br/>
So various, not to taste that onely Tree<br/>
Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,<br/>
So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,<br/>
Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst<br/>
God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree,<br/>
The only sign of our obedience left<br/>
Among so many signes of power and rule<br/>
Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n<br/>
Over all other Creatures that possesse<br/>
Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard<br/>
One easie prohibition, who enjoy<br/>
Free leave so large to all things else, and choice<br/>
Unlimited of manifold delights:<br/>
But let us ever praise him, and extoll<br/>
His bountie, following our delightful task<br/>
To prune these growing Plants, & tend these Flours,<br/>
Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.

To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom<br/>
And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,<br/>
And without whom am to no end, my Guide<br/>
And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.<br/>
For wee to him indeed all praises owe,<br/>
And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy<br/>
So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee<br/>
Preeminent by so much odds, while thou<br/>
Like consort to thy self canst no where find.<br/>
That day I oft remember, when from sleep<br/>
I first awak't, and found my self repos'd<br/>
Under a shade on flours, much wondring where<br/>
And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.<br/>
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound<br/>
Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread<br/>
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd<br/>
Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went<br/>
With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe<br/>
On the green bank, to look into the cleer<br/>
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.<br/>
As I bent down to look, just opposite,<br/>
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd<br/>
Bending to look on me, I started back,<br/>
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,<br/>
Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks<br/>
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt<br/>
Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,<br/>
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,<br/>
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,<br/>
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,<br/>
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies<br/>
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee<br/>
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy<br/>
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare<br/>
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd<br/>
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,<br/>
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?<br/>
Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,<br/>
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,<br/>
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,<br/>
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,<br/>
Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair EVE,<br/>
Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,<br/>
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent<br/>
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart<br/>
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side<br/>
Henceforth an individual solace dear;<br/>
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim<br/>
My other half: with that thy gentle hand<br/>
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see<br/>
How beauty is excelld by manly grace<br/>
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.

So spake our general Mother, and with eyes<br/>
Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,<br/>
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand<br/>
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast<br/>
Naked met his under the flowing Gold<br/>
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight<br/>
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms<br/>
Smil'd with superior Love, as JUPITER<br/>
On JUNO smiles, when he impregns the Clouds<br/>
That shed MAY Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip<br/>
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd<br/>
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne<br/>
Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind.

Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two<br/>
Imparadis't in one anothers arms<br/>
The happier EDEN, shall enjoy thir fill<br/>
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,<br/>
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,<br/>
Among our other torments not the least,<br/>
Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;<br/>
Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd<br/>
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:<br/>
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,<br/>
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?<br/>
Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord<br/>
Envie them that? can it be sin to know,<br/>
Can it be death? and do they onely stand<br/>
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,<br/>
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?<br/>
O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br/>
Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds<br/>
With more desire to know, and to reject<br/>
Envious commands, invented with designe<br/>
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt<br/>
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,<br/>
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?<br/>
But first with narrow search I must walk round<br/>
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;<br/>
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet<br/>
Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,<br/>
Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw<br/>
What further would be learnt. Live while ye may,<br/>
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,<br/>
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.

So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,<br/>
But with sly circumspection, and began<br/>
Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam.<br/>
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n<br/>
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun<br/>
Slowly descended, and with right aspect<br/>
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise<br/>
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock<br/>
Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,<br/>
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent<br/>
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;<br/>
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung<br/>
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.<br/>
Betwixt these rockie Pillars GABRIEL sat<br/>
Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;<br/>
About him exercis'd Heroic Games<br/>
Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand<br/>
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares<br/>
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.<br/>
Thither came URIEL, gliding through the Eeven<br/>
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr<br/>
In AUTUMN thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd<br/>
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner<br/>
From what point of his Compass to beware<br/>
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.

GABRIEL, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n<br/>
Charge and strict watch that to this happie place<br/>
No evil thing approach or enter in;<br/>
This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare<br/>
A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know<br/>
More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man<br/>
Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way<br/>
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;<br/>
But in the Mount that lies from EDEN North,<br/>
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks<br/>
Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd:<br/>
Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade<br/>
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew<br/>
I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise<br/>
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.

To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:<br/>
URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight,<br/>
Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,<br/>
See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass<br/>
The vigilance here plac't, but such as come<br/>
Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour<br/>
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,<br/>
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds<br/>
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude<br/>
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.<br/>
But if within the circuit of these walks<br/>
In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom<br/>
Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.

So promis'd hee, and URIEL to his charge<br/>
Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd<br/>
Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n<br/>
Beneath th' AZORES; whither the prime Orb,<br/>
Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd<br/>
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth<br/>
By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there<br/>
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold<br/>
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:<br/>
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray<br/>
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;<br/>
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,<br/>
They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests<br/>
Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;<br/>
She all night long her amorous descant sung;<br/>
Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament<br/>
With living Saphirs: HESPERUS that led<br/>
The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon<br/>
Rising in clouded Majestie, at length<br/>
Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,<br/>
And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw.

When ADAM thus to EVE: Fair Consort, th' hour<br/>
Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest<br/>
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set<br/>
Labour and rest, as day and night to men<br/>
Successive, and the timely dew of sleep<br/>
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines<br/>
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long<br/>
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;<br/>
Man hath his daily work of body or mind<br/>
Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,<br/>
And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies;<br/>
While other Animals unactive range,<br/>
And of thir doings God takes no account.<br/>
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East<br/>
With first approach of light, we must be ris'n,<br/>
And at our pleasant labour, to reform<br/>
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,<br/>
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,<br/>
That mock our scant manuring, and require<br/>
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:<br/>
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,<br/>
That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,<br/>
Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;<br/>
Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.

To whom thus EVE with perfet beauty adornd.<br/>
My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst<br/>
Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains,<br/>
God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more<br/>
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.<br/>
With thee conversing I forget all time,<br/>
All seasons and thir change, all please alike.<br/>
Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,<br/>
With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun<br/>
When first on this delightful Land he spreads<br/>
His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,<br/>
Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth<br/>
After soft showers; and sweet the coming on<br/>
Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night<br/>
With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,<br/>
And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train:<br/>
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends<br/>
With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun<br/>
On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,<br/>
Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,<br/>
Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night<br/>
With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,<br/>
Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.<br/>
But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom<br/>
This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?

To whom our general Ancestor repli'd.<br/>
Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht EVE,<br/>
Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,<br/>
By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land<br/>
In order, though to Nations yet unborn,<br/>
Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise;<br/>
Least total darkness should by Night regaine<br/>
Her old possession, and extinguish life<br/>
In Nature and all things, which these soft fires<br/>
Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate<br/>
Of various influence foment and warme,<br/>
Temper or nourish, or in part shed down<br/>
Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow<br/>
On Earth, made hereby apter to receive<br/>
Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.<br/>
These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,<br/>
Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,<br/>
That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;<br/>
Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth<br/>
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:<br/>
All these with ceasless praise his works behold<br/>
Both day and night: how often from the steep<br/>
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard<br/>
Celestial voices to the midnight air,<br/>
Sole, or responsive each to others note<br/>
Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands<br/>
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk<br/>
With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds<br/>
In full harmonic number joind, thir songs<br/>
Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.

Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd<br/>
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place<br/>
Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd<br/>
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe<br/>
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade<br/>
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew<br/>
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side<br/>
ACANTHUS, and each odorous bushie shrub<br/>
Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,<br/>
IRIS all hues, Roses, and Gessamin<br/>
Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought<br/>
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,<br/>
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay<br/>
Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone<br/>
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here<br/>
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;<br/>
Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower<br/>
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,<br/>
PAN or SILVANUS never slept, nor Nymph,<br/>
Nor FAUNUS haunted. Here in close recess<br/>
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs<br/>
Espoused EVE deckt first her Nuptial Bed,<br/>
And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,<br/>
What day the genial Angel to our Sire<br/>
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd,<br/>
More lovely then PANDORA, whom the Gods<br/>
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like<br/>
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son<br/>
Of JAPHET brought by HERMES, she ensnar'd<br/>
Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd<br/>
On him who had stole JOVES authentic fire.

Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood,<br/>
Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd<br/>
The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth & Heav'n<br/>
Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe<br/>
And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night,<br/>
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,<br/>
Which we in our appointed work imployd<br/>
Have finisht happie in our mutual help<br/>
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss<br/>
Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place<br/>
For us too large, where thy abundance wants<br/>
Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.<br/>
But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race<br/>
To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll<br/>
Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,<br/>
And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.

This said unanimous, and other Rites<br/>
Observing none, but adoration pure<br/>
Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower<br/>
Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off<br/>
These troublesom disguises which wee wear,<br/>
Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene<br/>
ADAM from his fair Spouse, nor EVE the Rites<br/>
Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd:<br/>
Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk<br/>
Of puritie and place and innocence,<br/>
Defaming as impure what God declares<br/>
Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.<br/>
Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain<br/>
But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?<br/>
Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source<br/>
Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,<br/>
In Paradise of all things common else.<br/>
By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men<br/>
Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee<br/>
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,<br/>
Relations dear, and all the Charities<br/>
Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.<br/>
Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,<br/>
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,<br/>
Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,<br/>
Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't,<br/>
Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd.<br/>
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights<br/>
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br/>
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile<br/>
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,<br/>
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours<br/>
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,<br/>
Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings<br/>
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.<br/>
These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,<br/>
And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof<br/>
Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on,<br/>
Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek<br/>
No happier state, and know to know no more.

Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone<br/>
Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,<br/>
And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim<br/>
Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd<br/>
To thir night watches in warlike Parade,<br/>
When GABRIEL to his next in power thus spake.

UZZIEL, half these draw off, and coast the South<br/>
With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,<br/>
Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part<br/>
Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.<br/>
From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld<br/>
That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

ITHURIEL and ZEPHON, with wingd speed<br/>
Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,<br/>
But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,<br/>
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.<br/>
This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd<br/>
Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen<br/>
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd<br/>
The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:<br/>
Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.

So saying, on he led his radiant Files,<br/>
Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct<br/>
In search of whom they sought: him there they found<br/>
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of EVE;<br/>
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach<br/>
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge<br/>
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,<br/>
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint<br/>
Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise<br/>
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise<br/>
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,<br/>
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires<br/>
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.<br/>
Him thus intent ITHURIEL with his Spear<br/>
Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure<br/>
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns<br/>
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts<br/>
Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark<br/>
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid<br/>
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store<br/>
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine<br/>
With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire:<br/>
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.<br/>
Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd<br/>
So sudden to behold the grieslie King;<br/>
Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.

Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell<br/>
Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,<br/>
Why satst thou like an enemie in waite<br/>
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?

Know ye not then said SATAN, filld with scorn,<br/>
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate<br/>
For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;<br/>
Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,<br/>
The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,<br/>
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin<br/>
Your message, like to end as much in vain?<br/>
To whom thus ZEPHON, answering scorn with scorn.<br/>
Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,<br/>
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known<br/>
As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;<br/>
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,<br/>
Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now<br/>
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.<br/>
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account<br/>
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep<br/>
This place inviolable, and these from harm.

So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke<br/>
Severe in youthful beautie, added grace<br/>
Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,<br/>
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw<br/>
Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd<br/>
His loss; but chiefly to find here observd<br/>
His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd<br/>
Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,<br/>
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,<br/>
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,<br/>
Or less be lost. Thy fear, said ZEPHON bold,<br/>
Will save us trial what the least can doe<br/>
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.

The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;<br/>
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,<br/>
Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie<br/>
He held it vain; awe from above had quelld<br/>
His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh<br/>
The western point, where those half-rounding guards<br/>
Just met, & closing stood in squadron joind<br/>
Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief<br/>
GABRIEL from the Front thus calld aloud.

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet<br/>
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne<br/>
ITHURIEL and ZEPHON through the shade,<br/>
And with them comes a third of Regal port,<br/>
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate<br/>
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,<br/>
Not likely to part hence without contest;<br/>
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.

He scarce had ended, when those two approachd<br/>
And brief related whom they brought, wher found,<br/>
How busied, in what form and posture coucht.

To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake.<br/>
Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd<br/>
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge<br/>
Of others, who approve not to transgress<br/>
By thy example, but have power and right<br/>
To question thy bold entrance on this place;<br/>
Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those<br/>
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?

To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow.<br/>
GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,<br/>
And such I held thee; but this question askt<br/>
Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?<br/>
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,<br/>
Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,<br/>
And boldly venture to whatever place<br/>
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change<br/>
Torment with ease, & soonest recompence<br/>
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br/>
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,<br/>
But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object<br/>
His will who bound us? let him surer barr<br/>
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay<br/>
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.<br/>
The rest is true, they found me where they say;<br/>
But that implies not violence or harme.

Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd,<br/>
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.<br/>
O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,<br/>
Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew,<br/>
And now returns him from his prison scap't,<br/>
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise<br/>
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither<br/>
Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;<br/>
So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br/>
However, and to scape his punishment.<br/>
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,<br/>
Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight<br/>
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br/>
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br/>
Can equal anger infinite provok't.<br/>
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee<br/>
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them<br/>
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they<br/>
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,<br/>
The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd<br/>
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,<br/>
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.<br/>
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,<br/>
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood<br/>
Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide<br/>
The blasting volied Thunder made all speed<br/>
And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.<br/>
But still thy words at random, as before,<br/>
Argue thy inexperience what behooves<br/>
From hard assaies and ill successes past<br/>
A faithful Leader, not to hazard all<br/>
Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd.<br/>
I therefore, I alone first undertook<br/>
To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie<br/>
This new created World, whereof in Hell<br/>
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find<br/>
Better abode, and my afflicted Powers<br/>
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;<br/>
Though for possession put to try once more<br/>
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;<br/>
Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord<br/>
High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,<br/>
And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight.

To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd.<br/>
To say and strait unsay, pretending first<br/>
Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,<br/>
Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't,<br/>
SATAN, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,<br/>
O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd!<br/>
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?<br/>
Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;<br/>
Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd,<br/>
Your military obedience, to dissolve<br/>
Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream?<br/>
And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem<br/>
Patron of liberty, who more then thou<br/>
Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd<br/>
Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope<br/>
To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?<br/>
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;<br/>
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre<br/>
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,<br/>
Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind,<br/>
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne<br/>
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.

So threatn'd hee, but SATAN to no threats<br/>
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd.

Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,<br/>
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then<br/>
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel<br/>
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King<br/>
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,<br/>
Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels<br/>
In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd.

While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright<br/>
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes<br/>
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round<br/>
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field<br/>
Of CERES ripe for harvest waving bends<br/>
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind<br/>
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands<br/>
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves<br/>
Prove chaff. On th' other side SATAN allarm'd<br/>
Collecting all his might dilated stood,<br/>
Like TENERIFF or ATLAS unremov'd:<br/>
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest<br/>
Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe<br/>
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds<br/>
Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise<br/>
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope<br/>
Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements<br/>
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne<br/>
With violence of this conflict, had not soon<br/>
Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray<br/>
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen<br/>
Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe,<br/>
Wherein all things created first he weighd,<br/>
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire<br/>
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,<br/>
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights<br/>
The sequel each of parting and of fight;<br/>
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;<br/>
Which GABRIEL spying, thus bespake the Fiend.

SATAN, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,<br/>
Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then<br/>
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more<br/>
Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now<br/>
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,<br/>
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign<br/>
Where thou art weigh'd, & shown how light, how weak,<br/>
If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew<br/>
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled<br/>
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.

<h2>Book 5</h2>

Now Morn, her rosy steps in the eastern clime<br/>
Advancing, sowed the earth with orient pearl,<br/>
When Adam waked, so customed; for his sleep<br/>
Was aerie light, from pure digestion bred,<br/>
And temperate vapours bland, which the only sound<br/>
Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan,<br/>
Lightly dispersed, and the shrill matin song<br/>
Of birds on every bough. So much the more<br/>
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve,<br/>
With tresses discomposed, and glowing cheek,<br/>
As through unquiet rest. He, on his side<br/>
Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love<br/>
Hung over her enamoured, and beheld<br/>
Beauty which, whether waking or asleep,<br/>
Shot forth peculiar graces; then, with voice<br/>
Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,<br/>
Her hand soft touching, whispered thus:—"Awake,<br/>
My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,<br/>
Heaven's last, best gift, my ever-new delight!<br/>
Awake! the morning shines, and the fresh field<br/>
Calls us; we lose the prime to mark how spring<br/>
Our tended plants, how blows the citron grove,<br/>
What drops the myrrh, and what the balmy reed,<br/>
How Nature paints her colours, how the bee<br/>
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet."

Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye<br/>
On Adam; whom imbracing, thus she spake:—

"O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,<br/>
My glory, my perfection! glad I see<br/>
Thy face, and morn returned; for I this night<br/>
(Such night till this I never passed) have dreamed,<br/>
If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,<br/>
Works of day past, or morrow's next design;<br/>
But of offence and trouble, which my mind<br/>
Knew never till this irksome night. Methought<br/>
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk<br/>
With gentle voice; I thought it thine. It said,<br/>
'Why sleep'st thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,<br/>
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields<br/>
To the night-warbling bird, that now awake<br/>
Tunes sweetest his love-laboured song; now reigns<br/>
Full-orbed the moon, and, with more pleasing light,<br/>
Shadowy sets off the face of things-in vain,<br/>
If none regard. Heaven wakes with all his eyes;<br/>
Whom to behold but thee, Nature's desire,<br/>
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment<br/>
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze?<br/>
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not:<br/>
To find thee I directed then my walk;<br/>
And on, methought, alone I passed through ways<br/>
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree<br/>
Of interdicted Knowledge. Fair it seemed,<br/>
Much fairer to my fancy than by day;<br/>
And, as I wondering looked, beside it stood<br/>
One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven<br/>
By us oft seen: his dewy locks distilled<br/>
Ambrosia. On that Tree he also gazed;<br/>
And, 'O fair plant,' said he, 'with fruit surcharged,<br/>
Deigns none to ease thy load, and taste thy sweet,<br/>
Nor God nor Man? Is knowledge so despised?<br/>
Or envy, or what reserve forbids to taste?<br/>
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold<br/>
Longer thy offered good, why else set here?<br/>
This said, he paused not, but with ventrous arm<br/>
He plucked, he tasted. Me damp horror chilled<br/>
At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold;<br/>
But he thus, overjoyed: 'O fruit divine,<br/>
Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet thus cropt,<br/>
Forbidden here, it seems, as only fit<br/>
For gods, yet able to make gods of men!<br/>
And why not gods of men, since good, the more<br/>
Communicated, more abundant grows,<br/>
The author not impaired, but honoured more?<br/>
Here, happy creature, fair angelic Eve!<br/>
Partake thou also: happy though thou art,<br/>
Happier thou may'st be, worthier canst not be.<br/>
Taste this, and be henceforth among the gods<br/>
Thyself a goddess; not to Earth confined,<br/>
But sometimes in the Air; as we; sometimes<br/>
Ascend to Heaven, by merit thine, and see<br/>
What life the gods live there, and such live thou.'<br/>
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,<br/>
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part<br/>
Which he had plucked: the pleasant savoury smell<br/>
So quickened appetite that I, methought,<br/>
Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the clouds<br/>
With him I flew, and underneath beheld<br/>
The Earth outstretched immense, a prospect wide<br/>
And various. Wondering at my flight and change<br/>
To this high exaltation, suddenly<br/>
My guide was gone, and I, methought, sunk down,<br/>
And fell asleep; but, O, how glad I waked<br/>
To find this but a dream!" Thus Eve her night<br/>
Related, and thus Adam answered sad:—

"Best image of myself, and dearer half,<br/>
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br/>
Affects me equally; nor can I like<br/>
This uncouth dream-of evil sprung, I fear;<br/>
Yet evil whence? In thee can harbour none,<br/>
Created pure. But know that in the soul<br/>
Are many lesser faculties, that serve<br/>
Reason as chief. Among these Fancy next<br/>
Her office holds; of all external things,<br/>
Which the five watchful senses represent,<br/>
She forms imaginations, aerie shapes,<br/>
Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames<br/>
All what we affirm or what deny, and call<br/>
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires<br/>
Into her private cell when Nature rests.<br/>
Oft, in her absence, mimic Fancy wakes<br/>
To imitate her; but, misjoining shapes,<br/>
Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams,<br/>
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.<br/>
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find<br/>
Of our last evening's talk in this thy dream,<br/>
But with addition strange. Yet be not sad:<br/>
Evil into the mind of God or Man<br/>
May come and go, so unapproved, and leave<br/>
No spot or blame behind; which gives me hope<br/>
That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream<br/>
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.<br/>
Be not disheartened, then, nor cloud those looks,<br/>
That wont to be more cheerful and serene<br/>
Than when fair Morning first smiles on the world;<br/>
And let us to our feesh imployments rise<br/>
Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers,<br/>
That open now their choicest bosomed smells,<br/>
Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store."

So cheered he his fair spouse; and she was cheered,<br/>
But silently a gentle tear let fall<br/>
From either eye, and wiped them with her hair:<br/>
Two other precious drops that ready stood,<br/>
Each in their crystal sluice, he, ere they fell,<br/>
Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse<br/>
And pious awe, that feared to have offended.

So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.<br/>
But first, from under shady arborous roof<br/>
Soon as they forth were come to open sight<br/>
Of day-spring, and the Sun-who, scarce uprisen,<br/>
With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,<br/>
Shot parallel to the Earth his dewy ray,<br/>
Discovering in wide lantskip all the east<br/>
Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains—<br/>
Lowly they bowed, adoring, and began<br/>
Their orisons, each morning duly paid<br/>
In various style; for neither various style<br/>
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise<br/>
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung<br/>
Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence<br/>
Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,<br/>
More tuneable than needed lute or harp<br/>
To add more sweetness. And they thus began:—

"These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,<br/>
Almighty! thine this universal frame,<br/>
Thus wondrous fair: Thyself how wondrous then!<br/>
Unspeakable! who sitt'st above these heavens<br/>
To us invisible, or dimly seen<br/>
In these thy lowest works; yet these declare<br/>
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.<br/>
Speak, ye who best can tell, ye Sons of Light,<br/>
Angels-for ye behold him, and with songs<br/>
And choral symphonies, day without night,<br/>
Circle his throne rejoicing-ye in Heaven;<br/>
On Earth join, all ye creatures, to extol<br/>
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.<br/>
Fairest of Stars, last in the train of Night,<br/>
If better thou belong not to the Dawn,<br/>
Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling morn<br/>
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere<br/>
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.<br/>
Thou Sun, of this great World both eye and soul,<br/>
Acknowledge him thy Greater; sound his praise<br/>
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,<br/>
And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fall'st.<br/>
Moon, that now meet'st the orient Sun, now fliest,<br/>
With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;<br/>
And ye five other wandering Fires, that move<br/>
In mystic dance, not without song, reasound<br/>
His praise who out of Darkness called up Light.<br/>
Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth<br/>
Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run<br/>
Perpetual circle, multiform, and mix<br/>
And nourish all things, let your ceaseless change<br/>
Vary to our great Maker still new praise.<br/>
Ye Mists and Exhalations, that now rise<br/>
From hill or steaming lake, dusky or gray,<br/>
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,<br/>
In honour to the World's great Author rise;<br/>
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky,<br/>
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers,<br/>
Rising or falling, still advance his praise.<br/>
His praise, ye Winds, that from four quarters blow,<br/>
Breathe soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,<br/>
With every Plant, in sign of worship wave.<br/>
Fountains, and ye, that warble, as ye flow,<br/>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.<br/>
Join voices, all ye living Souls. Ye Birds,<br/>
That, singing, up to Heaven-gate ascend,<br/>
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise.<br/>
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk<br/>
The earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep,<br/>
Witness if I be silent, morn or even,<br/>
To hill or valley, fountain, or fresh shade,<br/>
Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise.<br/>
Hail, universal Lord! Be bounteous still<br/>
To give us only good; and, if the night<br/>
Have gathered aught of evil, or concealed,<br/>
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark."

So prayed they innocent, and to their thoughts<br/>
Firm peace recovered soon, and wonted calm.<br/>
On to their morning's rural work they haste,<br/>
Among sweet dews and flowers, where any row<br/>
Of fruit-trees, over-woody, reached too far<br/>
Their pampered boughs, and needed hands to check<br/>
Fruitless imbraces; or they led the vine<br/>
To wed her elm; she, spoused, about him twines<br/>
Her marriageable arms, and with her brings<br/>
Her dower, the adopted clusters, to adorn<br/>
His barren leaves. Them thus imployed beheld<br/>
With pity Heaven's high King, and to him called<br/>
Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deigned<br/>
To travel with Tobias, and secured<br/>
His marriage with the seven-times-wedded maid.

"Raphael," said he, "thou hear'st what stir on Earth<br/>
Satan, from Hell scaped through the darksome Gulf,<br/>
Hath raised in Paradise, and how disturbed<br/>
This night the human pair; now he designs<br/>
In them at once to ruin all mankind.<br/>
Go, therefore; half this day, as friend with friend,<br/>
Converse with Adam, in what bower or shade<br/>
Thou find'st him from the heat of noon retired<br/>
To respite his day-labour with repast<br/>
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on<br/>
As may advise him of his happy state—<br/>
Happiness in his power left free to will,<br/>
Left to his own free will, his will though free<br/>
Yet mutable. Whence warn him to beware<br/>
He swerve not, too secure: tell him withal<br/>
His danger, and from whom; what enemy,<br/>
Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now<br/>
The fall of others from like state of bliss.<br/>
By violence? no, for that shall be withstood;<br/>
But by deceit and lies. This let him know,<br/>
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend<br/>
Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned."

So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled<br/>
All justice. Nor delayed the winged Saint<br/>
After his charge received; but from among<br/>
Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood<br/>
Veiled with his gorgeous wings, upspringing light,<br/>
Flew through the midst of Heaven. The angelic quires<br/>
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way<br/>
Through all the empyreal road, till, at the gate<br/>
Of Heaven arrived, the gate self-opened wide,<br/>
On golden hinges turning, as by work<br/>
Divine the sovran Architect had framed.<br/>
From hence-no cloud or, to obstruct his sight,<br/>
Star interposed, however small-he sees,<br/>
Not unconform to other shining globes,<br/>
Earth, and the Garden of God, with cedars crowned<br/>
Above all hills; as when by night the glass<br/>
Of Galileo, less assured, observes<br/>
Imagined lands and regions in the Moon;<br/>
Or pilot from amidst the Cyclades<br/>
Delos or Samos first appearing kens,<br/>
A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight<br/>
He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br/>
Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing<br/>
Now on the polar winds; then with quick fan<br/>
Winnows the buxom air, till, within soar<br/>
Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems<br/>
A phoenix, gazed by all, as that sole bird,<br/>
When, to enshrine his relics in the Sun's<br/>
Bright temple, to Aegyptian Thebes he flies.<br/>
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns,<br/>
A Seraph winged. Six wings he wore, to shade<br/>
His lineaments divine: the pair that clad<br/>
Each shoulder broad came mantling o'er his breast<br/>
With regal ornament; the middle pair<br/>
Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round<br/>
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold<br/>
And colours dipt in heaven; the third his feet<br/>
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail,<br/>
Sky-tinctured grain. Like Maia's son he stood,<br/>
And shook his plumes, that heavenly fragrance filled<br/>
The circuit wide. Straight knew him all the bands<br/>
Of Angels under watch, and to his state<br/>
And to his message high in honour rise;<br/>
For on some message high they guessed him bound.<br/>
Their glittering tents he passed, and now is come<br/>
Into the blissful field, through groves of myrrh,<br/>
And flowering odours, cassia, nard, and balm,<br/>
Aawilderness of sweets; for Nature here<br/>
Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will<br/>
Her virgin fancies, pouring forth more sweet,<br/>
Wild above rule or art, enormous bliss.<br/>
Him, through the spicy forest onward come,<br/>
Adam discerned, as in the door he sat<br/>
Of his cool bower, while now the mounted Sun<br/>
Shot down direct his fervid rays, to warm<br/>
Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs'<br/>
And Eve, within, due at her hour, prepared<br/>
For dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please<br/>
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst<br/>
Of nectarous draughts between, from milky stream,<br/>
Berry or grape: to whom thus Adam called:—

"Haste hither, Eve, and, worth thy sight, behold<br/>
Eastward among those trees what glorious Shape<br/>
Comes this way moving; seems another morn<br/>
Risen on mid-noon. Some great behest from Heaven<br/>
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe<br/>
This day to be our guest. But go with speed,<br/>
And what thy stores contain bring forth, and pour<br/>
Abundance fit to honour and receive<br/>
Our heavenly stranger; well may we afford<br/>
Our givers their own gifts, and large bestow<br/>
From large bestowed, where Nature multiplies<br/>
Her fertile growth, and by disburdening grows<br/>
More fruitful; which instructs us not to spare."

To whom thus Eve:—"Adam, Earth's hallowed mould,<br/>
Of God inspired, small store will serve where store,<br/>
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;<br/>
Save what, by frugal storing, firmness gains<br/>
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes.<br/>
But I will haste, and from each bough and brake,<br/>
Each plant and juiciest gourd, will pluck such choice<br/>
To entertain our Angel-guest as he,<br/>
Beholding, shall confess that here on Earth<br/>
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven."

So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste<br/>
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent<br/>
What choice to choose for delicacy best,<br/>
What order so contrived as not to mix<br/>
Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring<br/>
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change:<br/>
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk<br/>
Whatever Earth, all-bearing mother, yields<br/>
In India East or West, or middle shore<br/>
In Pontus or the Punic coast, or where<br/>
Alcinous reigned, fruit of all kinds, in coat<br/>
Rough or smooth-rined, or bearded husk, or shell,<br/>
She gathers, tribute large, and on the board<br/>
Heaps with unsparing hand. For drink the grape<br/>
She crushes, inoffensive must, and meaths<br/>
From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed<br/>
She tempers dulcet creams-nor those to hold<br/>
Wants her fit vessels pure; then strews the ground<br/>
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.

Meanwhile our primitive great Sire, to meet<br/>
His godlike guest, walks forth, without more train<br/>
Accompanied than with his own complete<br/>
Perfections; in himself was all his state,<br/>
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits<br/>
On princes, when their rich retin'ue long<br/>
Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold<br/>
Dazzles the crowd and sets them all agape.<br/>
Nearer his presence, Adam, though not awed,<br/>
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,<br/>
As to a superior nature, bowing low,<br/>
Thus said:—"Native of Heaven (for other place<br/>
None can than Heaven such glorious Shape contain),<br/>
Since, by descending from the Thrones above,<br/>
Those happy places thou hadst deigned a while<br/>
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us,<br/>
Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess<br/>
This spacious ground, in yonder shady bower<br/>
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears<br/>
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat<br/>
Be over, and the sun more cool decline."

Whom thus the angelic Virtue answered mild:—<br/>
"Adam, I therefore came; nor art thou such<br/>
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,<br/>
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heaven,<br/>
To visit thee. Lead on, then, where thy bower<br/>
O'ershades; for these mid-hours, till evening rise,<br/>
I have at will. "So to the sylvan lodge<br/>
They came, that like Pomona's arbour smiled,<br/>
With flowerets decked and fragrant smells. But Eve,<br/>
Undecked, save with herself, more lovely fair<br/>
Than wood-nymph, or the fairest goddess feigned<br/>
Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove,<br/>
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven; no veil<br/>
She needed, virtue-proof; no thought infirm<br/>
Altered her cheek. On whom the Angel "Hail!"<br/>
Bestowed-the holy salutation used<br/>
Long after to blest Mary, second Eve:—

"Hail! Mother of mankind, whose fruitful womb<br/>
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons<br/>
Than with these various fruits the trees of God<br/>
Have heaped this table!" Raised of grassy turf<br/>
Their table was, and mossy seats had round,<br/>
And on her ample square, from side to side,<br/>
All Autumn piled, though Spring and Autumn here<br/>
Danced hand-in-hand. A while discourse they hold—<br/>
No fear lest dinner cool-when thus began<br/>
Our Author:—"Heavenly Stranger, please to taste<br/>
These bounties, which our Nourisher, from whom<br/>
All perfect good, unmeasured-out, descends.<br/>
To us for food and for delight hath caused<br/>
The Earth to yield: unsavoury food, perhaps,<br/>
To Spiritual Natures; only this I know,<br/>
That one Celestial Father gives to all."

To whom the Angel:—"Therefore, what he gives<br/>
(Whose praise be ever sung) to Man, in part<br/>
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found<br/>
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure<br/>
Intelligential substances require<br/>
As doth your Rational; and both contain<br/>
Within them every lower faculty<br/>
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,<br/>
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,<br/>
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.<br/>
For know, whatever was created needs<br/>
To be sustained and fed. Of Elements<br/>
The grosser feeds the purer: Earth the Sea;<br/>
Earth and the Sea feed Air; the Air those Fires<br/>
Ethereal, and, as lowest, first the Moon;<br/>
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged,<br/>
Vapours not yet into her substance turned.<br/>
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale<br/>
From her moist continent to higher Orbs.<br/>
The Sun, that light imparts to all, receives<br/>
From all his alimental recompense<br/>
In humid exhalations, and at even<br/>
Sups with the Ocean. Though in Heaven the trees<br/>
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear, and vines<br/>
Yield nectar-though from off the boughs each morn<br/>
We brush mellifluous dews and find the ground<br/>
Covered with pearly grain-yet God hath here<br/>
Varied his bounty so with new delights<br/>
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste<br/>
Think not I shall be nice." So down they sat,<br/>
And to their viands fell; nor seemingly<br/>
The Angel, nor in mist-the common gloss<br/>
Of theologians-but with keen dispatch<br/>
Of real hunger, and concoctive heat<br/>
To transubstantiate: what redounds transpires<br/>
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder, if by fire<br/>
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist<br/>
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn,<br/>
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold,<br/>
As from the mine. Meanwhile at table Eve<br/>
Ministered naked, and their flowing cups<br/>
With pleasant liquors crowned. O innocence<br/>
Deserving Paradise! If ever, then,<br/>
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have been<br/>
Enamoured at that sight. But in those hearts<br/>
Love unlibidinous reigned, nor jealousy<br/>
Was understood, the injured lover's hell.

Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed,<br/>
Not burdened nature, sudden mind arose<br/>
In Adam not to let the occasion pass,<br/>
Given him by this great conference, to know<br/>
Of things above his world, and of their being<br/>
Who dwell in Heaven, whose excellence he saw<br/>
Transcend his own so far, whose radiant forms,<br/>
Divine effulgence, whose high power so far<br/>
Exceeded human; and his wary speech<br/>
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed:—

Inhabitant with God, now know I well<br/>
They favour, in this honour done to Man;<br/>
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsafed<br/>
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,<br/>
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so<br/>
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem<br/>
At Heaven's high feasts to have fed: yet what compare!"<br/>
To whom the winged Hierarch replied:—<br/>
"O Adam, one almighty is, from whom<br/>
All things proceed, and up to him return,<br/>
If not depraved from good, created all<br/>
Such to perfection; one first matter all,<br/>
Indued with various forms, various degrees<br/>
Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;<br/>
But more refined, more spiritous and pure,<br/>
As nearer to him placed or nearer tending<br/>
Each in their several active spheres assigned,<br/>
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds<br/>
Proportioned to each kind. So from the root<br/>
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves<br/>
More aerie, last the bright consummate flower<br/>
Spirits odorous breathes: flowers and their fruit,<br/>
Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,<br/>
To vital spirits aspire, to animal,<br/>
To intellectual; give both life and sense,<br/>
Fancy and understanding; whence the Soul<br/>
Reason receives, and Reason is her being,<br/>
Discursive, or Intuitive: Discourse<br/>
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,<br/>
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.<br/>
Wonder not, then, what God for you saw good<br/>
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,<br/>
To proper substance. Time may come when Men<br/>
With Angels may participate, and find<br/>
No inconvenient diet, nor too light fare;<br/>
And from these corporal nutriments, perhaps,<br/>
Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit,<br/>
Improved by tract of time, and winged ascend<br/>
Ethereal, as we, or may at choice<br/>
Here or in heavenly paradises dwell,<br/>
If ye be found obedient, and retain<br/>
Unalterably firm his love entire<br/>
Whose progeny you are. Meanwhile enjoy,<br/>
Your fill, what happiness this happy state<br/>
Can comprehend, incapable of more."

To whom the Patriarch of Mankind replied:—<br/>
"O favourable Spirit, propitious guest,<br/>
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct<br/>
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set<br/>
From centre to circumference, whereon,<br/>
In contemplation of created things,<br/>
By steps we may ascend to God. But say,<br/>
What meant that caution joined, If ye be found<br/>
Obedient? Can we want obedience, then,<br/>
To him, or possibly his love desert,<br/>
Who formed us from the dust, and placed us here<br/>
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss<br/>
Human desires can seek or apprehend?"

To whom the Angel:—"Son of Heaven and Earth,<br/>
Attend! That thou art happy, owe to God;<br/>
That thou continuest such, owe to thyself,<br/>
That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.<br/>
This was that caution given thee; be advised.<br/>
God made thee perfect, not immutable;<br/>
And good he made thee; but to persevere<br/>
He left it in thy power-ordained thy will<br/>
By nature free, not over-ruled by fate<br/>
Inextricable, or strict necessity.<br/>
Our voluntary service he requires,<br/>
Not our necessitated. Such with him<br/>
Finds no acceptance, nor can find; for how<br/>
Can hearts not free be tried whether they serve<br/>
Willing or no, who will but what they must<br/>
By destiny, and can no other choose?<br/>
Myself, and all the Angelic Host, that stand<br/>
In sight of god enthroned, our happy state<br/>
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds.<br/>
On other surety none: freely we serve,<br/>
Because we freely love, as in our will<br/>
To love or not; in this we stand or fall.<br/>
And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,<br/>
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell. Of fall<br/>
From what high state of bliss into what woe!"

To whom our great Progenitor:—"Thy words<br/>
Attentive, and with more delighted ear,<br/>
Divine instructor, I have heard, than when<br/>
Cherubic songs by night from neighbouring hills<br/>
Aerial music send. Nor knew I not<br/>
To be, both will and deed, created free.<br/>
Yet that we never shall forget to love<br/>
Our Maker, and obey him whose command<br/>
Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts<br/>
Assured me, and still assure; though what thou tell'st<br/>
Hath passed in Heaven some doubt within me move,<br/>
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,<br/>
The full relation, which must needs be strange,<br/>
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard.<br/>
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun<br/>
Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins<br/>
His other half in the great zone of heaven."

Thus Adam made request; and Raphael,<br/>
After short pause assenting, thus began:—

"High matter thou injoin'st me, O prime of Men—<br/>
Sad task and hard; for how shall I relate<br/>
To human sense the invisible exploits<br/>
Of warring Spirits? how, without remorse,<br/>
The ruin of so many, glorious once<br/>
And perfect while they stood? how, last, unfold<br/>
The secrets of another world, perhaps<br/>
Not lawful to reveal? Yet for thy good<br/>
This is dispensed; and what surmounts the reach<br/>
Of human sense I shall delineate so,<br/>
By likening spiritual to corporal forms,<br/>
As may express them best-though what if Earth<br/>
Be but the shadow of Heaven, and things therein<br/>
Each to other like more than on Earth is thought!

"As yet this World was not, and Chaos wild<br/>
Reigned where these heavens now rowl, where Earth now rests<br/>
Upon her centre poised, when on a day<br/>
(For Time, though in Eternity, applied<br/>
To motion, measures all things durable<br/>
By present, past, and future), on such day<br/>
As Heaven's great year brings forth, the empyreal host<br/>
Of Angels, by imperial summons called,<br/>
Innumerable before the Almighty's throne<br/>
Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared<br/>
Under their hierarchs in orders bright.<br/>
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced,<br/>
Standards and gonfalons, 'twixt van and rear<br/>
Stream in the air, and for distinction serve<br/>
Of hierarchies, of orders, and degrees:<br/>
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed<br/>
Holy memorials, acts of zeal and love<br/>
Recorded eminent. Thus when in orbs<br/>
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,<br/>
Orb within orb, the Father Infinite,<br/>
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son,<br/>
Amidst, as from a flaming Mount, whose top<br/>
Brightness had made invisible, thus spake:

"'Hear, all ye Angels, Progeny of Light,<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,<br/>
Hear my decree, which unrevoked shall stand!<br/>
This day I have begot whom I declare<br/>
My only Son, and on this holy hill<br/>
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold<br/>
At my right hand. Your head I him appoint,<br/>
And by myself have sworn to him shall bow<br/>
All knees in Heaven, and shall confess him Lord.<br/>
Under his great vicegerent reign abide,<br/>
United as one individual soul,<br/>
For ever happy. Him who disobeys<br/>
Me disobeys, breaks union, and, that day,<br/>
Cast out form God and blessed vision, falls<br/>
Into utter darkness, deep ingulfed, his place<br/>
Ordained without redemption, without end.'

"So spake the Omnipotent, and with his words<br/>
All seemed well pleased; all seemed, but were not all.<br/>
That day, as other solemn days, they spent<br/>
In song and dance about the sacred Hill—<br/>
Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere<br/>
Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels<br/>
Resembles, nearest; mazes intricate,<br/>
Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular<br/>
Then most when most irregular they seem;<br/>
And in their motions harmony divine<br/>
So smooths her charming tones that God's own ear<br/>
Listens delighted. Evening now approached<br/>
(For we have also our evening and our morn—<br/>
We ours for change delectable, not need);<br/>
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn<br/>
Desirous: all in circles as they stood,<br/>
Tables are set, and on a sudden piled<br/>
With Angels' food; and rubied nectar flows<br/>
In pearl, in diamond, and massy gold,<br/>
Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.<br/>
On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,<br/>
They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet<br/>
Quaff immortality and joy, secure<br/>
Of surfeit where full measure only bounds<br/>
Excess, before the all-bounteous King, who showered<br/>
With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.<br/>
Now when ambrosial Night, with clouds exhaled<br/>
From that high mount of God whence light and shade<br/>
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed<br/>
To grateful twilight (for Night comes not there<br/>
In darker veil), and roseate dews disposed<br/>
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,<br/>
Wide over all the plain, and wider far<br/>
Than all this globous Earth in plain outspread<br/>
(Such are the Courts of God), the Angelic throng,<br/>
Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend<br/>
By living streams among the trees of life—<br/>
Pavilions numberless and sudden reared,<br/>
Celestial tabernacles, where they slept,<br/>
Fanned with cool winds; save those who, in their course,<br/>
Melodious hymns about the sovran Throne<br/>
Alternate all night long. But not so waked<br/>
Satan-so call him now; his former name<br/>
Is heard no more in Heaven. He, of the first,<br/>
If not the first Archangel, great in power,<br/>
In favour, and preeminence, yet fraught<br/>
With envy against the Son of God, that day<br/>
Honoured by his great Father, and proclaimed<br/>
Messiah, King Anointed, could not bear,<br/>
Through pride, that sight, and thought himself impaired.<br/>
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,<br/>
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour<br/>
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolved<br/>
With all his legions to dislodge, and leave<br/>
Unworshiped, unobeyed, the Throne supreme.<br/>
Contemptuous, and, his next subordinate<br/>
Awakening, thus to him in secret spake:—

"'Sleep'st thou, companion dear? what sleep can close<br/>
Thy eyelids? and rememberest what decree,<br/>
Of yesterday, so late hath passed the lips<br/>
Of Heaven's Almighty? Thou to me thy thoughts<br/>
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont, to impart;<br/>
Both waking we were one; how, then, can now<br/>
Thy sleep dissent? New laws thou seest imposed;<br/>
New laws from him who reigns new minds may raise<br/>
In us who serve-new counsels, to debate<br/>
What doubtful may ensue. More in this place<br/>
To utter is not safe. Assemble thou<br/>
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief;<br/>
Tell them that, by command, ere yet dim Night<br/>
Her shadowy cloud withdraws, I am to haste,<br/>
And all who under me their banners wave,<br/>
Homeward with flying march where we possess<br/>
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare<br/>
Fit entertainment to receive our King,<br/>
The great Messiah, and his new commands,<br/>
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies<br/>
Intends to pass triumphant, and give laws.'

"So spake the false Archangel, and infused<br/>
Bad influence into the unwary breast<br/>
Of his associate. He together calls,<br/>
Or several one by one, the regent Powers,<br/>
Under him regent; tells, as he was taught,<br/>
That, the Most High commanding, now ere Night,<br/>
Now ere dim Night had disincumbered Heaven,<br/>
The great hierarchal standard was to move;<br/>
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between<br/>
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound<br/>
Or taint integrity. But all obeyed<br/>
The wonted signal, and superior voice<br/>
Of their great Potentate; for great indeed<br/>
His name, and high was his degree in Heaven:<br/>
His countenance, as the morning-star that guides<br/>
The starry flock allured them, and with lies<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's host.<br/>
Meanwhile, the Eternal Eye, whose sight discerns<br/>
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount,<br/>
And from within the golden Lamps that burn<br/>
Nightly before him, saw without their light<br/>
Rebellion rising-saw in whom, how spread<br/>
Among the Sons of Morn, what multitudes<br/>
Were banded to oppose his high decree;<br/>
And, smiling, to his only Son thus said:—

"'Son, thou in whom my glory I behold<br/>
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,<br/>
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure<br/>
Of our Omnipotence, and with what arms<br/>
We mean to hold what anciently we claim<br/>
Of deity or empire: such a foe<br/>
Is rising, who intends to erect his throne<br/>
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;<br/>
Nor so content, hath in his thought to try<br/>
In battle what our power is or our right.<br/>
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw<br/>
With speed what force is left, and all imploy<br/>
In our defence, lest unawares we lose<br/>
This our high place, our Sanctuary, our Hill.'

"To whom the Son, with calm aspect and clear<br/>
Lightening divine, ineffable, serene,<br/>
Made answer:—'Mighty Father, thou thy foes<br/>
Justly hast in derision, and secure<br/>
Laugh'st at their vain designs and tumults vain—<br/>
Matter to me of glory, whom their hate<br/>
Illustrates, when they see all regal power<br/>
Given me to quell their pride, and in event<br/>
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue<br/>
Thy rebels, or be found the worst in Heaven.'

"So spake the Son; but Satan with his Powers<br/>
Far was advanced on winged speed, an host<br/>
Innumerable as the stars of night,<br/>
Or stars of morning, dew-drops which the sun<br/>
Impearls on every leaf and every flower.<br/>
Regions they passed, the mighty regencies<br/>
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones<br/>
In their triple degrees-regions to which<br/>
All thy dominion, Adam, is no more<br/>
Than what this garden is to all the earth<br/>
And all the sea, from one entire globose<br/>
Stretched into longitude; which having passed,<br/>
At length into the limits of the North<br/>
They came, and Satan to his royal seat<br/>
High on a hill, far-blazing, as a mount<br/>
Raised on a mount, with pyramids and towers<br/>
From diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold—<br/>
The palace of great Lucifer (so call<br/>
That structure, in the dialect of men<br/>
Interpreted) which, not long after, he,<br/>
Affecting all equality with God,<br/>
In imitation of that mount whereon<br/>
Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven,<br/>
The Mountain of the Congregation called;<br/>
For thither he assembled all his train,<br/>
Pretending so commanded to consult<br/>
About the great reception of their King<br/>
Thither to come, and with calumnious art<br/>
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears:—

"'Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers—<br/>
If these magnific titles yet remain<br/>
Not merely titular, since by decree<br/>
Another now hath to himself ingrossed<br/>
All power, and us eclipsed under the name<br/>
Of King Anointed; for whom all this haste<br/>
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,<br/>
This only to consult, how we may best,<br/>
With what may be devised of honours new,<br/>
Receive him coming to receive from us<br/>
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile!<br/>
Too much to one! but double how endured—<br/>
To one and to his image now proclaimed?<br/>
But what if better counsels might erect<br/>
Our minds, and teach us to cast off this yoke!<br/>
Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend<br/>
The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust<br/>
To know ye right, or if ye know yourselves<br/>
Natives and Sons of Heaven possessed before<br/>
By none, and, if not equal all, yet free,<br/>
Equally free; for orders and degrees<br/>
Jar not with liberty, but well consist.<br/>
Who can in reason, then, or right, assume<br/>
Monarchy over such as live by right<br/>
His equals-if in power and splendour less,<br/>
In freedom equal? or can introduce<br/>
Law and edict on us, who without law<br/>
Err not? much less for this to be our Lord,<br/>
And look for adoration, to the abuse<br/>
Of those imperial titles which assert<br/>
Our being ordained to govern, not to serve!

"Thus far his bold discourse without control<br/>
Had audience, when, among the Seraphim,<br/>
Abdiel, than whom none with more zeal adored<br/>
The Deity, and divine commands obeyed,<br/>
Stood up, and in a flame of zeal severe<br/>
The current of his fury thus opposed:—

"'O argument blasphe mous, false, and proud—<br/>
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven<br/>
Expected; least of all from thee, ingrate,<br/>
In place thyself so high above thy peers!<br/>
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn<br/>
The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,<br/>
That to his only Son, by right endued<br/>
With regal sceptre, every soul in Heaven<br/>
Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due<br/>
Confess him rightful King? Unjust, thou say'st,<br/>
Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,<br/>
And equal over equals to let reign,<br/>
One over all with unsucceeded power!<br/>
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute<br/>
With Him the points of liberty, who made<br/>
Thee what Thou art, and formed the Powers of Heaven<br/>
Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?<br/>
Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,<br/>
And of our good and of our dignity<br/>
How provident, he is-how far from thought<br/>
To make us less; bent rather to exalt<br/>
Our happy state, under one Head more near<br/>
United. But-to grant it thee unjust<br/>
That equal over equals monarch reign—<br/>
Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,<br/>
Or all angelic nature joined in one,<br/>
Equal to him, begotten Son, by whom,<br/>
As by his Word, the mighty Father made<br/>
All things, even thee, and all the Spirits of Heaven<br/>
By him created in their bright degrees,<br/>
Crowned them with glory, and to their glory named<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers?—<br/>
Essential Powers; nor by his reign obscured,<br/>
But more illustrious made; since he, the head,<br/>
One of our number thus reduced becomes;<br/>
His laws our laws; all honour to him done<br/>
Returns our own. Cease, then, this impious rage,<br/>
And tempt not these; but hasten to appease<br/>
The incensed Father and the incensed Son<br/>
While pardon may be found, in time besought.'

"So spake the fervent Angel; but his zeal<br/>
None seconded, as out of season judged,<br/>
Or singular and rash. Whereat rejoiced<br/>
The Apostat, and, more haughty, thus replied:—

"'That we were formed, then, say'st thou? and the work<br/>
Of secondary hands, by task transferred<br/>
From Father to his Son? Strange point and new!<br/>
Doctrine which we would know whence learned! Who saw<br/>
When this creation was? Remember'st thou<br/>
Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?<br/>
We know no time when we were not as now;<br/>
Know none before us, self-begot, self-raised<br/>
By our own quickening power when fatal course<br/>
Had circled his full orb, the birth mature<br/>
Of this our native Heaven, Ethereal Sons.<br/>
Our puissance is our own; our own right hand<br/>
Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try<br/>
Who is our equal. Then thou shalt behold<br/>
Whether by supplication we intend<br/>
Address, and to begirt the Almighty Throne<br/>
Beseeching or besieging. This report,<br/>
These tidings, carry to the Anointed King;<br/>
And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.'

"He said; and, as the sound of waters deep,<br/>
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause<br/>
Through the infinite Host. Nor less for that<br/>
The flaming Seraph, fearless, though alone,<br/>
Encompassed round with foes, thus answered bold:—

"'O alienate from God, O Spirit accursed,<br/>
Forsaken of all good! I see thy fall<br/>
Determined, and thy hapless crew involved<br/>
In this perfidious fraud, contagion spread<br/>
Both of thy crime and punishment. Henceforth<br/>
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke<br/>
Of God's Messiah. Those indulgent laws<br/>
Will not be now voutsafed; other decrees<br/>
Against thee are gone forth without recall;<br/>
That golden sceptre which thou didst reject<br/>
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break<br/>
Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise;<br/>
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly<br/>
These wicked tents devoted, lest the wrauth<br/>
Impendent, raging into sudden flame,<br/>
Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel<br/>
His thunder on thy head, devouring fire.<br/>
Then who can created thee lamenting learn<br/>
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.'

"So spake the Seraph Abdiel, faithful found;<br/>
Among the faithless faithful only he;<br/>
Among innumerable false unmoved,<br/>
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,<br/>
His loyalty he kept, his love, his zeal;<br/>
Nor number nor example with him wrought<br/>
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,<br/>
Though single. From amidst them forth he passed,<br/>
Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustained<br/>
Superior, nor of violence feared aught;<br/>
And with retorted scorn his back he turned<br/>
On those proud towers, to swift destruction doomed."

<h2>Book 6</h2>

"All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,<br/>
Through Heaven's wide champaign held his way, till Morn,<br/>
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand<br/>
Unbarred the gates of Light. There is a cave<br/>
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,<br/>
Where Light and Darkness in perpetual round<br/>
Lodge and dislodge by turns-which makes through Heaven<br/>
Grateful vicissitude, like day and night;<br/>
Light issues forth, and at the other door<br/>
Obsequious Darkness enters, till her hour<br/>
To veil the heaven, though darkness there might well<br/>
Seem twilight here. And now went forth the Morn<br/>
Such as in highest heaven, arrayed in gold<br/>
Empyreal; from before her vanished Night,<br/>
Shot through with orient beams; when all the pain<br/>
Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright,<br/>
Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,<br/>
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view.<br/>
War he perceived, war in precinct, and found<br/>
Already known what he for news had thought<br/>
To have reported. Gladly then he mixed<br/>
Among those friendly Powers, who him received<br/>
With joy and acclamations loud, that one,<br/>
That of so many myriads fallen yet one,<br/>
Returned not lost. On to the sacred Hill<br/>
They led him, high applauded, and present<br/>
Before the Seat supreme; from whence a voice,<br/>
From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard:—

"'Servant of God, well done! Well hast thou fought<br/>
The better fight, who single hast maintained<br/>
Against revolted multitudes the cause<br/>
Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms,<br/>
And for the testimony of truth hast borne<br/>
Universal reproach, far worse to bear<br/>
Than violence; for this was all thy care—<br/>
To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds<br/>
Judged thee perverse. The easier conquest now<br/>
Remains thee-aided by this host of friends,<br/>
Back on thy foes more glorious to return<br/>
Than scorned thou didst depart: and to subdue,<br/>
By force who reason for their law refuse—<br/>
Right reason for their law, and for their King<br/>
Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.<br/>
Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,<br/>
And thou, in military prowess next,<br/>
Gabriel; lead forth to battle these my sons<br/>
Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,<br/>
By thousands and by millions ranged for fight,<br/>
Equal in number to that godless crew<br/>
Rebellious. Them with fire and hostile arms<br/>
Fearless assault; and, to the brow of Heaven<br/>
Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss<br/>
Into their place of punishment, the gulf<br/>
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide<br/>
His fiery chaos to receive their fall.'

"So spake the Sovran Voice; and clouds began<br/>
To darken all the Hill, and smoke to rowl<br/>
In dusky wreaths reluctant flames, the sign<br/>
Of wrauth awaked; nor with less dread the loud<br/>
Ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow.<br/>
At which command the Powers Militant<br/>
That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate joined<br/>
Of union irresistible, moved on<br/>
In silence their bright legions to the sound<br/>
Of instrumental harmony, that breathed<br/>
Heroic ardour to adventurous deeds<br/>
Under their godlike leaders, in the cause<br/>
Of God and his Messiah. On they move,<br/>
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,<br/>
Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides<br/>
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground<br/>
Their march was, and the passive air upbore<br/>
Their nimble tread. As when the total kind<br/>
Of birds, in orderly array on wing,<br/>
Came summoned over Eden to receive<br/>
Their names of thee; so over many a tract<br/>
Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,<br/>
Tenfold the length of this terrene. At last<br/>
Far in the horizon, to the north, appeared<br/>
From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched<br/>
In battailous aspect; and, nearer view,<br/>
Bristled with upright beams innumerable<br/>
Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields<br/>
Various, with boastful argument portrayed,<br/>
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on<br/>
With furious expedition: for they weened<br/>
That self-same day, by fight or by surprise,<br/>
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne<br/>
To set the envier of his state, the proud<br/>
Aspirer. But their thoughts proved fond and vain<br/>
In the mid-way; though strange to us it seemed<br/>
At first that Angel should with Angel war,<br/>
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet<br/>
So oft in festivals of joy and love<br/>
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire,<br/>
Hymning the Eternal Father. But the shout<br/>
Of battle now began, and rushing sound<br/>
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.<br/>
High in the midst, exalted as a God,<br/>
The Apostat in his sun-bright chariot sat,<br/>
Idol of majesty divine, enclosed<br/>
With flaming Cherubim and golden shields;<br/>
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne-for now<br/>
'Twixt host and host but narrow space was left,<br/>
A dreadful interval, and front to front<br/>
Presented stood, in terrible array<br/>
Of hideous length. Before the cloudy van,<br/>
On the rough edge of battle ere it joined,<br/>
Satan, with vast and haughty strides advanced,<br/>
Came towering, armed in adamant and gold.<br/>
Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood<br/>
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,<br/>
And thus his own undaunted heart explores:—

"'O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest<br/>
Should yet remain, where faith and realty<br/>
Remain not! Wherefore should not strength and might<br/>
There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove<br/>
Where boldest, though to sight unconquerable?<br/>
His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,<br/>
I mean to try, whose reason I have tried<br/>
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just<br/>
That he who in debate of truth hath won<br/>
Should win in arms, in both disputes alike<br/>
Victor. Though brutish that contest' and foul,<br/>
When reason hath to deal with force, yet so<br/>
Most reason is that reason overcome.'

"So pondering, and from his armed peers<br/>
Forth-stepping opposite, half-way he met<br/>
His daring foe, at this prevention more<br/>
Incensed, and thus securely him defied:—

"'Proud, art thou met? Thy hope was to have reached<br/>
The highth of thy aspiring unopposed—<br/>
The Throne of God unguarded, and his side<br/>
Abandoned at the terror of thy power<br/>
Or potent tongue. Fool! not to think how vain<br/>
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;<br/>
Who, out of smallest things, could without end<br/>
Have raised incessant armies to defeat<br/>
Thy folly; or with solitary hand,<br/>
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,<br/>
Unaided could have finished thee, and whelmed<br/>
Thy legions under darkness! But thou seest<br/>
All are not of thy train; there be who faith<br/>
Prefer, and piety to God, though then<br/>
To thee not visible when I alone<br/>
Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent<br/>
From all: my Sect thou seest; now learn too late<br/>
How few sometimes may know when thousands err.'

"Whom the grand Foe, with scornful eye askance,<br/>
Thus answered:—'Ill for thee, but in wished hour<br/>
Of my revenge, first sought for, thou return'st<br/>
From flight, seditious Angel, to receive<br/>
Thy merited reward, the first assay<br/>
Of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,<br/>
Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose<br/>
A third part of the Gods, in synod met<br/>
Their deities to assert: who, while they feel<br/>
Vigour divine within them, can allow<br/>
Omnipotence to none. But well thou com'st<br/>
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win<br/>
From me some plume, that thy success may show<br/>
Destruction to the rest. This pause between<br/>
(Unanswered lest thou boast) to let thee know.—<br/>
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven<br/>
To heavenly souls had been all one; but now<br/>
I see that most through sloth had rather serve,<br/>
Ministering Spirits, trained up in feast and song;<br/>
Such hast thou armed, the minstrelsy of heaven—<br/>
Servility with freedom to contend,<br/>
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.'

"To whom, in brief, thus Abdiel stern replied:—<br/>
'Apostat! still thou err'st, no end wilt find<br/>
Of erring, from the path of truth remote.<br/>
Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name<br/>
Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,<br/>
Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same,<br/>
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels<br/>
Them whom he governs. This is servitude—<br/>
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled<br/>
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,<br/>
Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled;<br/>
Yet lewdly dar'st our ministering upbraid.<br/>
Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve<br/>
In Heaven god ever blest, and His Divine<br/>
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed.<br/>
Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect: meanwhile,<br/>
From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,<br/>
This greeting on thy impious crest receive.'

"So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,<br/>
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell<br/>
On the proud crest of Satan that no sight,<br/>
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,<br/>
Such ruin intercept. Ten paces huge<br/>
He back recoiled; the tenth on bended knee<br/>
His massy spear upstayed: as if, on earth,<br/>
Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,<br/>
Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat,<br/>
Half-sunk with all his pines. Amazement seized<br/>
The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see<br/>
Thus foiled their mightiest; ours joy filled, and shout,<br/>
Presage of victory, and fierce desire<br/>
Of battle: whereat Michael bid sound<br/>
The Archangel trumpet. Through the vast of Heaven<br/>
It sounded, and the faithful armies rung<br/>
Hosannah to the Highest; nor stood at gaze<br/>
The adverse legions, nor less hideous joined<br/>
The horrid shock. Now storming fury rose,<br/>
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now.<br/>
Was never; arms on armour clashing brayed<br/>
Horrible discord, and the madding wheels<br/>
Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise<br/>
Of conflict; overhead the dismal hiss<br/>
Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,<br/>
And, flying, vaulted either host with fire.<br/>
So under fiery cope together rushed<br/>
Both battles main with ruinous assault<br/>
And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven<br/>
Resounded; and, had Earth been then, all Earth<br/>
Had to her centre shook. What wonder, when<br/>
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought<br/>
On either side, the least of whom could yield<br/>
These elements, and arm him with the force<br/>
Of all their regions? How much more of power<br/>
Army against army numberless to raise<br/>
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,<br/>
Though not destroy, their happy native seat;<br/>
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent<br/>
From his strong hold of Heaven high overruled<br/>
And limited their might, though numbered such<br/>
As each divided legion might have seemed<br/>
A numerous host, in strength, each armed hand<br/>
A legion! Led in fight, yet leader seemed<br/>
Each warrior single as in chief; expert<br/>
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br/>
Of battle, open when, and when to close<br/>
The ridges of grim war. No thought of flight,<br/>
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed<br/>
That argued fear; each on himself relied<br/>
As only in his arm the moment lay<br/>
Of victory. Deeds of eternal fame<br/>
Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread<br/>
That war, and various: sometimes on firm ground<br/>
A standing fight; then, soaring on main wing,<br/>
Tormented all the air; all air seemed then<br/>
Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale<br/>
The battle hung; till Satan, who that day<br/>
Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms<br/>
No equal, ranging through the dire attack<br/>
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length<br/>
Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felled<br/>
Squadrons at once: with huge two-handed sway<br/>
Brandished aloft, the horrid edge came down<br/>
Wide-wasting. Such destruction to withstand<br/>
He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb<br/>
Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,<br/>
A vast circumference. At his approach<br/>
The great Archangel from his warlike toil<br/>
Surceased, and, glad, as hoping here to end<br/>
Intestine war in Heaven, the Arch-foe subdued,<br/>
Or captive dragged in chains, with hostile frown<br/>
And visage all inflamed, first thus began:—

"'Author of Evil, unknown till thy revolt,<br/>
Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest<br/>
These acts of hateful strife-hateful to all,<br/>
Though heaviest, by just measure, on thyself<br/>
And thy adherents-how hast thou disturbed<br/>
Heaven's blessed peace, and into Nature brought<br/>
Misery, uncreated till the crime<br/>
Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instilled<br/>
Thy malice into thousands, once upright<br/>
And faithful, now proved false! But think not here<br/>
To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out<br/>
From all her confines; Heaven, the seat of bliss,<br/>
Brooks not the works of violence and war.<br/>
Hence, then, and Evil go with thee along,<br/>
Thy offspring, to the place of Evil, Hell—<br/>
Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils!<br/>
Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,<br/>
Or some more sudden vengeance, winged from God,<br/>
Precipitate thee with augmented pain.'

"So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus<br/>
The Adversary:—'Nor think thou with wind<br/>
Of airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds<br/>
Thou canst not. Hast thou turned the least of these<br/>
To flight-or, if to fall, but that they rise<br/>
Unvanquished-easier to transact with me<br/>
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats<br/>
To chase me hence? Err not that so shall end<br/>
The strife which thou call'st evil, but we style<br/>
The strife of glory; which we mean to win,<br/>
Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell<br/>
Thou fablest; here, however, to dwell free,<br/>
If not to reign. Meanwhile, thy utmost force—<br/>
And join Him named Almighty to thy aid—<br/>
I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.'

"They ended parle, and both addressed for fight<br/>
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue<br/>
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things<br/>
Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift<br/>
Human imagination to such highth<br/>
Of godlike power? for likest gods they seemed,<br/>
Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,<br/>
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.<br/>
Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air<br/>
Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields<br/>
Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood<br/>
In horror; from each hand with speed retired,<br/>
Where erst was thickest fight, the Angelic throng,<br/>
And left large field, unsafe with the wind<br/>
Of such commotion: such as (to set forth<br/>
Great things by small) if, Nature's concord broke,<br/>
Among the constellations war were sprung,<br/>
Two planets, rushing from aspect' malign<br/>
Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky<br/>
Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.<br/>
Together both, with next to Almighty arm<br/>
Uplifted imminent, one stroke they aimed<br/>
That might determine, and not need repeat<br/>
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeared<br/>
In might or swift prevention. But the sword<br/>
Of Michael from the armoury of God<br/>
Was given him tempered so that neither keen<br/>
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met<br/>
The sword of Satan, with steep force to smite<br/>
Descending, and in half cut sheer; nor stayed,<br/>
But, with swift wheel reverse, deep entering, shared<br/>
All his right side. Then Satan first knew pain,<br/>
And writhed him to and fro convolved; so sore<br/>
The griding sword with discontinuous wound<br/>
Passed through him. But the ethereal substance closed,<br/>
Not long divisible; and from the gash<br/>
A stream of nectarous humour issuing flowed<br/>
Sanguin, such as celestial Spirits may bleed,<br/>
And all his armour stained, erewhile so bright,<br/>
Forthwith, on all sides, to his aid was run<br/>
By Angels many and strong, who interposed<br/>
Defence, while others bore him on their shields<br/>
Back to his chariot where it stood retired<br/>
From off the files of war: there they him laid<br/>
Gnashing for anguish, and despite, and shame<br/>
To find himself not matchless, and his pride<br/>
Humbled by such rebuke, so far beneath<br/>
His confidence to equal God in power.<br/>
Yet soon he healed; for Spirits, that live throughout<br/>
Vital in every part-not, as frail Man,<br/>
In entrails, heart or head, liver or reins—<br/>
Cannot but by annihilating die;<br/>
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound<br/>
Receive, no more than can the fluid air:<br/>
All heart they live, all head, all eye, all ear,<br/>
All intellect, all sense; and as they please<br/>
They limb themselves, and colour, shape, or size<br/>
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.

"Meanwhile, in other parts, like deeds deserved<br/>
Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought,<br/>
And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array<br/>
Of Moloch, furious king, who him defied,<br/>
And at his chariot-wheels to drag him bound<br/>
Threatened, nor from the Holy One of Heaven<br/>
Refreined his tongue blasphemous, but anon,<br/>
Down cloven to the waist, with shattered arms<br/>
And uncouth pain fled bellowing. On each wing<br/>
Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe,<br/>
Though huge and in a rock of diamond armed,<br/>
Vanquished-Adramelech and Asmadai,<br/>
Two potent Thrones, that to be less than Gods<br/>
Disdained, but meaner thoughts learned in their flight,<br/>
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail.<br/>
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy<br/>
The atheist crew, but with redoubled blow<br/>
Ariel, and Arioch, and the violence<br/>
Of Ramiel, scorched and blasted, overthrew.<br/>
I might relate of thousands, and their names<br/>
Eternize here on Earth; but those elect<br/>
Angels, contented with their fame in Heaven,<br/>
Seek not the praise of men: the other sort,<br/>
In might though wondrous and in acts of war,<br/>
Nor or renown less eager, yet by doom<br/>
Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory,<br/>
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell<br/>
For strength from truth divided, and from just,<br/>
Illaudable, nought merits but dispraise<br/>
And ignominy, yet to glory aspires,<br/>
Vain-glorious, and through infamy seeks fame:<br/>
Therefore eternal silence be their doom!

"And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved,<br/>
With many an inroad gored; deformed rout<br/>
Entered, and foul disorder; all the ground<br/>
With shivered armour strown, and on a heap<br/>
Chariot and charioter lay overturned,<br/>
And fiery foaming steeds; what stood recoiled,<br/>
O'er-wearied, through the faint Satanic host,<br/>
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised—<br/>
Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain—<br/>
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought<br/>
By sin of disobedience, till that hour<br/>
Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.<br/>
Far otherwise the inviolable Saints<br/>
In cubic phalanx firm advanced entire,<br/>
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed;<br/>
Such high advantages their innocence<br/>
Gave them above their foes-not to have sinned,<br/>
Not to have disobeyed; in fight they stood<br/>
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained<br/>
By wound, though from their place by violence moved.

"Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven<br/>
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,<br/>
And silence on the odious din of war.<br/>
Under her cloudy covert both retired,<br/>
Victor and Vanquished. On the foughten field<br/>
Michael and his Angels, prevalent<br/>
Encamping, placed in guard their watches round,<br/>
Cherubic waving fires: on the other part,<br/>
Satan with his rebellious disappeared,<br/>
Far in the dark dislodged, and, void of rest,<br/>
His Potentates to council called by night,<br/>
And in the midst thus undismayed began:—

"'O now in danger tried, now known in arms<br/>
Not to be overpowered, companions dear,<br/>
Found worthy not of liberty alone—<br/>
Too mean pretence-but, what we more affect,<br/>
Honour, dominion, glory and renown;<br/>
Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight<br/>
(And, if one day, why not eternal days?)<br/>
What Heaven's Lord had powerfullest to send<br/>
Against us from about his Throne, and judged<br/>
Sufficient to subdue us to his will,<br/>
But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,<br/>
Of future we may deem him, though till now<br/>
Omniscient thought! True is, less firmly armed,<br/>
Some disadvantage we endured, and pain—<br/>
Till now not known, but, known, as soon contemned;<br/>
Since now we find this our empyreal form<br/>
Incapable of mortal injury,<br/>
Imperishable, and, though pierced with wound,<br/>
Soon closing, and by native vigour healed.<br/>
Of evil, then, so small as easy think<br/>
The remedy: perhaps more valid arms,<br/>
Weapons more violent, when next we meet,<br/>
May serve to better us and worse our foes,<br/>
Or equal what between us made the odds,<br/>
In nature none. If other hidden cause<br/>
Left them superior, while we can preserve<br/>
Unhurt our minds, and understanding sound,<br/>
Due search and consultation will disclose,'

"He sat; and in the assembly next upstood<br/>
Nisroch, of Principalities the prime.<br/>
As one he stood escaped from cruel fight<br/>
Sore toiled, his riven arms to havoc hewn,<br/>
And, cloudy in aspect, thus answering spake:—

"'Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free<br/>
Enjoyment of our right as Gods! yet hard<br/>
For Gods, and too unequal work, we find<br/>
Against unequal arms to fight in pain,<br/>
Against unpained, impassive; from which evil<br/>
Ruin must needs ensue. For what avails<br/>
Valour or strength, though matchless, quelled with pain,<br/>
Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands<br/>
Of mightiest? Sense of pleasure we may well<br/>
Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,<br/>
But live content-which is the calmest life;<br/>
But pain is perfect misery, the worst<br/>
Of evils, and, excessive, overturns<br/>
All patience. He who, therefore, can invent<br/>
With what more forcible we may offend<br/>
Our yet unwounded enemies, or arm<br/>
Ourselves with like defence, to me deserves<br/>
No less than for deliverance what we owe.'

"Whereto, with look composed, Satan replied:—<br/>
'Not uninvented that, which thou aright<br/>
Believ'st so main to our success, I bring.<br/>
Which of us who beholds the bright surface<br/>
Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand—<br/>
This continent of spacious Heaven, adorned<br/>
With plant, fruit, flower ambrosial, gems and gold—<br/>
Whose eye so superficially surveys<br/>
These things as not to mind from whence they grow<br/>
Deep under ground: materials dark and crude,<br/>
Of spirituous and fiery spume, till, touched<br/>
With Heaven's ray, and tempered, they shoot forth<br/>
So beauteous, opening to the ambient light?<br/>
These in their dark nativity the Deep<br/>
Shall yield us, pregnant with infernal flame;<br/>
Which, into hollow engines long and round<br/>
Thick-rammed, at the other bore with touch of fire<br/>
Dilated and infuriate, shall send forth<br/>
From far, with thundering noise, among our foes<br/>
Such implements of mischief as shall dash<br/>
To pieces and o'erwhelm whatever stands<br/>
Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmed<br/>
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.<br/>
Nor long shall be our labour; yet ere dawn<br/>
Effect shall end our wish. Meanwhile revive;<br/>
Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joined<br/>
Think nothing hard, much less to be despaired.'

"He ended; and his words their drooping cheer<br/>
Enlightened, and their languished hope revived.<br/>
The invention all admired, and each how he<br/>
To be the inventor missed; so easy it seemed,<br/>
Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought<br/>
Impossible! Yet, haply, of thy race,<br/>
In future days, if malice should abound,<br/>
Some one, intent on mischief, or inspired<br/>
With devilish machination, might devise<br/>
Like instrument to plague the sons of men<br/>
For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.<br/>
Forthwith from council to the work they flew;<br/>
None arguing stood; innumerable hands<br/>
Were ready; in a moment up they turned<br/>
Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath<br/>
The originals of Nature in their crude<br/>
Conception; sulphurous and nitrous foam<br/>
They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art<br/>
Concocted and adusted, they reduced<br/>
To blackest grain, and into store conveyed.<br/>
Part hidden veins digged up (nor hath this Earth<br/>
Entrails unlike) of mineral and stone,<br/>
Whereof to found their engines and their balls<br/>
Of missive ruin; part incentive reed<br/>
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.<br/>
So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night,<br/>
Secret they finished, and in order set,<br/>
With silent circumspection, unespied.

"Now, when fair Morn orient in Heaven appeared,<br/>
Up rose the victor Angels, and to arms<br/>
The matin trumpet sung. In arms they stood<br/>
Of golden panoply, refulgent host,<br/>
Soon banded; others from the dawning hills<br/>
Looked round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,<br/>
Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,<br/>
Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,<br/>
In motion or in halt. Him soon they met<br/>
Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow<br/>
But firm battalion: back with speediest sail<br/>
Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,<br/>
Came flying, and in mid air aloud thus cried:—

"'Arm, Warriors, arm for fight! The foe at hand,<br/>
Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit<br/>
This day; fear not his flight; so thick a cloud<br/>
He comes, and settled in his face I see<br/>
Sad resolution and secure. Let each<br/>
His adamantine coat gird well, and each<br/>
Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,<br/>
Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,<br/>
If I conjecture aught, no drizzling shower,<br/>
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire.'

"So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon<br/>
In order, quit of all impediment.<br/>
Instant, without disturb, they took alarm,<br/>
And onward more embattled: when, behold,<br/>
Not distant far, with heavy pace the Foe<br/>
Approaching gross and huge, in hollow cube<br/>
Training his devilish enginery, impaled<br/>
On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,<br/>
To hide the fraud. At interview both stood<br/>
A while; but suddenly at head appeared<br/>
Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud:—

"'Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold,<br/>
That all may see who hate us how we seek<br/>
Peace and composure, and with open breast<br/>
Stand ready to receive them, if they like<br/>
Our overture, and turn not back perverse:<br/>
But that I doubt. However, witness Heaven!<br/>
Heaven, witness thou anon! while we discharge<br/>
Freely our part. Ye, who appointed stand,<br/>
Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch<br/>
What we propound, and loud that all may hear.'

"So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce<br/>
Had ended, when to right and left the front<br/>
Divided, and to either flank retired;<br/>
Which to our eyes discovered, new and strange,<br/>
A triple mounted row of pillars laid<br/>
On wheels (for like to pillars most they seemed,<br/>
Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir,<br/>
With branches lopt, in wood or mountain felled),<br/>
Brass, iron, stony mould, had not their mouths<br/>
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide,<br/>
Portending hollow truce. At each, behind,<br/>
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a reed<br/>
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we, suspense,<br/>
Collected stood within our thoughts amused.<br/>
Not long! for sudden all at once their reeds<br/>
Put forth, and to a narrow vent applied<br/>
With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,<br/>
But soon obscured with smoke, all Heaven appeared,<br/>
From those deep-throated engines belched, whose roar<br/>
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,<br/>
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul<br/>
Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail<br/>
Of iron globes; which, on the Victor Host<br/>
Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,<br/>
That whom they hit none on their feet might stand,<br/>
Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell<br/>
By thousands, Angel on Archangel rowled,<br/>
The sooner for their arms. Unarmed, they might<br/>
Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift<br/>
By quick contraction or remove; but now<br/>
Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout;<br/>
Nor served it to relax their serried files.<br/>
What should they do? If on they rushed, repulse<br/>
Repeated, and indecent overthrow<br/>
Doubled, would render them yet more despised,<br/>
And to their foes a laughter-for in view<br/>
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,<br/>
In posture to displode their second tire<br/>
Of thunder; back defeated to return<br/>
They worse abhorred. Satan beheld their plight,<br/>
And to his mates thus in derision called:—

"'O friends, why come not on these victors proud?<br/>
Erewhile they fierce were coming; and, when we,<br/>
To entertain them fair with open front<br/>
And breast (what could we more?), propounded terms<br/>
Of composition, straight they changed their minds,<br/>
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,<br/>
As they would dance. Yet for a dance they seemed<br/>
Somewhat extravagant and wild; perhaps<br/>
For joy of offered peace. But I suppose,<br/>
If our proposals once again were heard,<br/>
We should compel them to a quick result.'

"To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood:<br/>
'Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,<br/>
Of hard contents, and full of force urged home,<br/>
Such as we might perceive amused them all,<br/>
And stumbled many. Who receives them right<br/>
Had need from head to foot well understand;<br/>
Not understood, this gift they have besides—<br/>
They shew us when our foes walk not upright.'

"So they among themselves in pleasant vein<br/>
Stood scoffing, heightened in their thoughts beyond<br/>
All doubt of victory; Eternal Might<br/>
To match with their inventions they presumed<br/>
So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,<br/>
And all his host derided, while they stood<br/>
A while in trouble. But they stood not long;<br/>
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms<br/>
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.<br/>
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power,<br/>
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)<br/>
Their arms away they threw, and to the hills<br/>
(For Earth hath this variety from Heaven<br/>
Of pleasure situate in hill and dale)<br/>
Light as the lightning-glimpse they ran, they flew,<br/>
From their foundations, loosening to and fro,<br/>
They plucked the seated hills, with all their load,<br/>
Rocks, waters, woods, and, by the shaggy tops<br/>
Uplifting, bore them in their hands. Amaze,<br/>
Be sure, and terror, seized the rebel Host,<br/>
When coming towards them so dread they saw<br/>
The bottom of the mountains upward turned,<br/>
Till on those cursed engines' triple row<br/>
They sawethem whelmed, and all their confidence<br/>
Under the weight of mountains buried deep;<br/>
Themselves invaded next, and on their heads<br/>
Main promontories flung, which in the air<br/>
Came shadowing, and oppressed whole legions armed.<br/>
Their armour helped their harm, crushed in and bruised,<br/>
Into their substance pent-which wrought them pain<br/>
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,<br/>
Long struggling underneath, ere they could wind<br/>
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,<br/>
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.<br/>
The rest, in imitation, to like arms<br/>
Betook them, and the neighbouring hills uptore;<br/>
So hills amid the air encountered hills,<br/>
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire,<br/>
That underground they fought in dismal shade:<br/>
Infernal noise! war seemed a civil game<br/>
To this uproar; horrid confusion heaped<br/>
Upon confusion rose. And now all Heaven<br/>
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread,<br/>
Had not the Almighty Father, where he sits<br/>
Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure,<br/>
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen<br/>
This tumult, and permitted all, advised,<br/>
That his great purpose he might so fulfil,<br/>
To honour his Anointed Son, avenged<br/>
Upon his enemies, and to declare<br/>
All power on him transferred. Whence to his Son,<br/>
The assessor of his Throne, he thus began:—

"'Effulgence of my glory, Son beloved,<br/>
Son in whose face invisible is beheld<br/>
Visibly, what by Deity I am,<br/>
And in whose hand what by decree I do,<br/>
Second Omnipotence! two days are passed,<br/>
Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,<br/>
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame<br/>
These disobedient. Sore hath been their fight,<br/>
As likeliest was when two such foes met armed:<br/>
For to themselves I left them; and thou know'st<br/>
Equal in their creation they were formed,<br/>
Save what sin hath impaired-which yet hath wrought<br/>
Insensibly, for I suspend their doom:<br/>
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last<br/>
Endless, and no solution will be found.<br/>
War wearied hath performed what war can do,<br/>
And to disordered rage let loose the reins,<br/>
With mountains, as with weapons, armed; which makes<br/>
Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.<br/>
Two days are, therefore, passed; the third is thine:<br/>
For thee I have ordained it, and thus far<br/>
Have suffered, that the glory may be thine<br/>
Of ending this great war, since none but thou<br/>
Can end it. Into thee such virtue and grace<br/>
Immense I have transfused, that all may know<br/>
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare,<br/>
And this perverse commotion governed thus,<br/>
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir<br/>
Of all things-to be Heir, and to be King<br/>
By sacred unction, thy deserved right.<br/>
Go, then, thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might;<br/>
Ascend my chariot; guide the rapid wheels<br/>
That shake Heaven's basis; bring forth all my war;<br/>
My bow and thunder, my Almighty arms,<br/>
Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;<br/>
Pursue these Sons of Darkness, drive them out<br/>
From all Heaven's bounds into the utter Deep;<br/>
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br/>
God, and Messiah his anointed King.'

"He said, and on his Son with rays direct<br/>
Shon full. He all his Father full expressed<br/>
Ineffably into his face received;<br/>
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake:—

"'O Father, O Supreme of Heavenly Thrones,<br/>
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou always seek'st<br/>
To glorify thy Son; I always thee,<br/>
As is most just. This I my glory account,<br/>
My exaltation, and my whole delight,<br/>
That thou in me, well pleased, declar'st thy will<br/>
Fulfilled, which to fulfil is all my bliss.<br/>
Sceptre and power, thy giving, I assume,<br/>
And gladlier shall resign when in the end<br/>
Thou shalt be all in all, and I in thee<br/>
For ever, and in me all whom thou lov'st.<br/>
But whom thou hat'st I hate, and can put on<br/>
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,<br/>
Image of thee in all things: and shall soon,<br/>
Armed with thy might, rid Heaven of these rebelled,<br/>
To their prepared ill mansion driven down,<br/>
To chains of darkness and the undying Worm,<br/>
That from thy just obedience could revolt,<br/>
Whom to obey is happiness entire.<br/>
Then shall thy Saints, unmixed, and from the impure<br/>
Far separate, circling thy holy Mount,<br/>
Unfeigned halleluiahs to thee sing,<br/>
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief,'

"So said, He, o'er his sceptre bowing, rose<br/>
From the right hand of Glory where He sat;<br/>
And the third sacred morn began to shine,<br/>
Dawning through Heaven. Forth rushed with whirlwind sound<br/>
The chariot of Paternal Deity,<br/>
Flashing thick flames, wheel within wheel; undrawn,<br/>
Itself instinct with spirit, but convoyed<br/>
By four cherubic Shapes. Four faces each<br/>
Had wondrous; as with stars, their bodies all<br/>
And wings were set with eyes; with eyes the wheels<br/>
Of beryl, and careering fires between;<br/>
Over their heads a crystal firmament,<br/>
Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure<br/>
Amber and colours of the showery arch.<br/>
He, in celestial panoply all armed<br/>
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,<br/>
Ascended; at his right hand Victory<br/>
Sat eagle-winged; beside him hung his bow,<br/>
And quiver, with three-bolted thunder stored;<br/>
And from about him fierce effusion rowled<br/>
Of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire.<br/>
Attended with ten thousand Saints,<br/>
He onward came; far off his coming shon;<br/>
And twenty thousand (I their number heard)<br/>
Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen.<br/>
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime<br/>
On the crystallin sky, in saphir throned—<br/>
Illustrious far and wide, but by his own<br/>
First seen. Them unexpected joy surprised<br/>
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed<br/>
Aloft, by Angels borne, his Sign in Heaven;<br/>
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced<br/>
His army, circumfused on either wing,<br/>
Under their Head embodied all in one.<br/>
Before him Power Divine his way prepared;<br/>
At his command the uprooted hills retired<br/>
Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went<br/>
Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renewed,<br/>
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.

"This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,<br/>
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,<br/>
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.<br/>
In Heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?<br/>
But to convince the proud what signs avail,<br/>
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?<br/>
They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,<br/>
Grieving to see his glory, at the sight<br/>
Took envy, and, aspiring to his highth,<br/>
Stood re-imbattled fierce, by force or fraud<br/>
Weening to prosper, and at length prevail<br/>
Against God and Messiah, or to fall<br/>
In universal ruin last; and now<br/>
To final battle drew, disdaining flight,<br/>
Or faint retreat: when the great Son of God<br/>
To all his host on either hand thus spake:—

"'Stand still in bright array, ye Saints; here stand,<br/>
Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest.<br/>
Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God<br/>
Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause;<br/>
And, as ye have received, so have ye done,<br/>
Invincibly. But of this cursed crew<br/>
The punishment to other hand belongs;<br/>
Vengeance is his, or whose He sole appoints.<br/>
Number to this day's work is not ordained,<br/>
Nor multitude; stand only and behold<br/>
God's indignation on these godless poured<br/>
By me. Not you, but me, they have despised,<br/>
Yet envied; against me is all their rage,<br/>
Because the Father, to whom in Heaven supreme<br/>
Kingdom and power and glory appertains,<br/>
Hath honoured me, according to his will.<br/>
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned,<br/>
That they may have their wish, to try with me<br/>
In battle which the stronger proves-they all,<br/>
Or I alone against them; since by strength<br/>
They measure all, of other excellence<br/>
Not emulous, nor care who them excels;<br/>
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.'

"So spake the Son, and into terror changed<br/>
His countenance, too severe to be beheld,<br/>
And full of wrauth bent on his enemies.<br/>
At once the Four spread out their starry wings<br/>
With dreadful shade continguous, and the orbs<br/>
Of his fierce chariot rowled, as with the sound<br/>
Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.<br/>
He on his impious foes right onward drove,<br/>
Gloomy as Night. Under his burning wheels<br/>
The steadfast Empyrean shook throughout,<br/>
All but the Throne itself of God. Full soon<br/>
Among them he arrived, in his right hand<br/>
Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent<br/>
Before him, such as in their souls infixed<br/>
Plagues. They, astonished, all resistance lost,<br/>
All courage; down their idle weapons dropt;<br/>
O'er shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode<br/>
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostate,<br/>
That wished the mountains now might be again<br/>
Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.<br/>
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell<br/>
His arrows, from the fourfold-visaged Four,<br/>
Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels,<br/>
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes;<br/>
One spirit in them ruled, and every eye<br/>
Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire<br/>
Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,<br/>
And of their wonted vigour left them drained,<br/>
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen,<br/>
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked<br/>
His thunder in mid-volley; for he meant<br/>
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven.<br/>
The overthrown he raised, and, as a herd<br/>
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged,<br/>
Drove them before him thunderstruck, pursued<br/>
With terrors and with furies to the bounds<br/>
And crystal wall of Heaven; which, opening wide,<br/>
Rowled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed<br/>
Into the wasteful Deep. The monstrous sight<br/>
Strook them with horror backward; but far worse<br/>
Urged them behind: headlong themselves they threw<br/>
Down from the verge of Heaven: eternal wrauth<br/>
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

"Hell heard the unsufferable noise; Hell saw<br/>
Heaven ruining from Heaven, and would have fled<br/>
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep<br/>
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.<br/>
Nine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared,<br/>
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall<br/>
Through his wild Anarchy; so huge a rout<br/>
Incumbered him with ruin. Hell at last,<br/>
Yawning, received them whole, and on them closed—<br/>
Hell, their fit habitation, fraught with fire<br/>
Unquenchable, the house of woe and pain.<br/>
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced, and soon repaired<br/>
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowled.<br/>
Sole victor, from the expulsion of his foes<br/>
Messiah his triumphal chariot turned.<br/>
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood<br/>
Eye-witnesses of His Almighty acts,<br/>
With jubilee advanced; and, as they went,<br/>
Shaded with branching palm, each order bright<br/>
Sung triumph, and him sung victorious King,<br/>
Son, Heir, and Lord, to him dominion given,<br/>
Worthiest to reign. He celebrated rode<br/>
Triumphant through mid Heaven, into the courts<br/>
And temple of his mighty Father throned<br/>
On high; who into glory him received,<br/>
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.

"Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,<br/>
At thy request, and that thou may'st beware<br/>
By what is past, to thee I have revealed<br/>
What might have else to human race been hid—<br/>
The discord which befell, and war in Heaven<br/>
Among the Angelic Powers, and the deep fall<br/>
Of those too high aspiring who rebelled<br/>
With Satan: he who envies now thy state,<br/>
Who now is plotting how he may seduce<br/>
Thee also from obedience, that, with him<br/>
Bereaved of happiness, thou may'st partake<br/>
His punishment, eternal misery;<br/>
Which would be all his solace and revenge,<br/>
As a despite done against the Most High,<br/>
Thee once to gain companion of his woe.<br/>
But listen not to his temptations; warn<br/>
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard,<br/>
By terrible example, the reward<br/>
Of disobedience. Firm they might have stood,<br/>
Yet fell. Remember, and fear to transgress."

<h2>Book 7</h2>

Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name<br/>
If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine<br/>
Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,<br/>
Above the flight of Pegasean wing!<br/>
The meaning, not the name, I call; for thou<br/>
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top<br/>
Of old Olympus dwell'st; but, heavenly-born,<br/>
Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed,<br/>
Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,<br/>
Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play<br/>
In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased<br/>
With thy celestial song. Up led by thee,<br/>
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,<br/>
An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,<br/>
Thy tempering. With like safety guided down,<br/>
Return me to my native element;<br/>
Lest, from this flying steed unreined (as once<br/>
Bellerophon, though from a lower clime)<br/>
Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,<br/>
Erroneous there to wander and forlorn.<br/>
Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound<br/>
Within the visible Diurnal Sphere.<br/>
Standing on Earth, not rapt above the pole,<br/>
More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged<br/>
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,<br/>
On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,<br/>
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,<br/>
And solitude; yet not alone, while thou<br/>
Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when Morn<br/>
Purples the East. Still govern thou my song,<br/>
Urania, and fit audience find, though few.<br/>
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance<br/>
Of Bacchus and his revellers, the race<br/>
Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian Bard<br/>
In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears<br/>
To rapture, till the savage clamour drowned<br/>
Both harp and voice; nor could the Muse defend<br/>
Her son. So fail not thou who thee implores;<br/>
For thou art heavenly, she an empty dream.

Say, Goddess, what ensued when Raphael,<br/>
The affable Archangel, had forewarned<br/>
Adam, by dire example, to beware<br/>
Apostasy, by what befell in Heaven<br/>
To those apostates, lest the like befall<br/>
In Paradise to Adam or his race,<br/>
Charged not to touch the interdicted Tree,<br/>
If they transgress, and slight that sole command,<br/>
So easily obeyed amid the choice<br/>
Of all tastes else to please their appetite,<br/>
Though wandering. He, with his consorted Eve,<br/>
The story heard attentive, and was filled<br/>
With admiration and deep muse, to hear<br/>
Of things so high and strange-things to their thought<br/>
So unimaginable as hate in Heaven,<br/>
And was so near the peace of God in bliss,<br/>
With such confusion; but the evil, soon<br/>
Driven back, redounded as a flood on those<br/>
From whom it sprung, impossible to mix<br/>
With blessedness. Whence Adam soon repealed<br/>
The doubts that in his heart arose; and, now<br/>
Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know<br/>
What nearer might concern him-how this World<br/>
Of heaven and earth conspicuous first began;<br/>
When, and whereof, created; for what cause;<br/>
What within Eden, or without, was done<br/>
Before his memory-as one whose drouth,<br/>
Yet scarce allayed, still eyes the current stream,<br/>
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,<br/>
Proceeded thus to ask his Heavenly Guest:—

"Great things, and full of wonder in our ears,<br/>
Far differing from this World, thou hast revealed,<br/>
Divine Interpreter! by favour sent<br/>
Down from the Empyrean to forewarn<br/>
Us timely of what might else have been our loss,<br/>
Unknown, which human knowledge could not reach;<br/>
For which to the infinitely Good we owe<br/>
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment<br/>
Receive with solemn purpose to observe<br/>
Immutably his sovran will, the end<br/>
Of what we are. But, since thou hast voutsafed<br/>
Gently, for our instruction, to impart<br/>
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concerned<br/>
Our knowing, as to highest Wisdom seemed,<br/>
Deign to descend now lower, and relate<br/>
What may no less perhaps avail us known—<br/>
How first began this Heaven which we behold<br/>
Distant so high, with moving fires adorned<br/>
Innumerable; and this which yields or fills<br/>
All space, the ambient Air, wide interfused,<br/>
Imbracing round this florid Earth; what cause<br/>
Moved the Creator, in his holy rest<br/>
Through all eternity, soelate to build<br/>
In Chaos; and, the work begun, how soon<br/>
Absolved: if unforbid thou may'st unfold<br/>
What we not to explore the secrets ask<br/>
Of his eternal empire, but the more<br/>
To magnify his works the more we know.<br/>
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run<br/>
Much of his race, though steep. Suspense in heaven<br/>
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears<br/>
And longer will delay, to hear thee tell<br/>
His generation, and the rising birth<br/>
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:<br/>
Or, if the Star of Evening and the Moon<br/>
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring<br/>
Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch;<br/>
Or we can bid his absence till thy song<br/>
End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine."

Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought;<br/>
And thus the godlike Angel answered mild:—

"This also thy request, with caution asked,<br/>
Obtain; though to recount Almighty works<br/>
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,<br/>
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?<br/>
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve<br/>
To glorify the Maker, and infer<br/>
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld<br/>
Thy hearing. Such commission from above<br/>
I have received, to answer thy desire<br/>
Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain<br/>
To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope<br/>
Things not revealed, which the invisible King,<br/>
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night,<br/>
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven,<br/>
Enough is left besides to search and know;<br/>
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less<br/>
Her temperance over appetite, to know<br/>
In measure what the mind may well contain;<br/>
Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns<br/>
Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.

"Know then that, after Lucifer from Heaven<br/>
(So call him, brighter once amidst the host<br/>
Of Angels then that star the stars among)<br/>
Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep<br/>
Into his place, and the great Son returned<br/>
Victorious with his Saints, the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father from his Throne beheld<br/>
Their multitude, and to his Son thus spake:—

"'At least our envious foe hath failed, who thought<br/>
All like himself rebellious; by whose aid<br/>
This inaccessible high strength, the seat<br/>
Of Deity supreme, us dispossessed,<br/>
He trusted to have seized, and into fraud<br/>
Drew many whom their place knows here no more.<br/>
Yet far the greater part have kept, I see,<br/>
Their station; Heaven, yet populous, retains<br/>
Number sufficient to possess her realms,<br/>
Though wide, and this high temple to frequent<br/>
With ministeries due and solemn rites.<br/>
But, lest his heart exalt him in the harm<br/>
Already done, to have dispeopled Heaven—<br/>
My damage fondly deemed-I can repair<br/>
That detriment, if such it be to lose<br/>
Self-lost, and in a moment will create<br/>
Another world; out of one man a race<br/>
Of men innumerable, there to dwell,<br/>
Not here, till, by degrees of merit raised,<br/>
They open to themselves at length the way<br/>
Up hither, under long obedience tried,<br/>
And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,<br/>
One kingdom, joy and union without end.<br/>
Meanwhile inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven;<br/>
And thou, my Word, begotten Son, by thee<br/>
This I perform; speak thou, and be it done!<br/>
My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee<br/>
I send along; ride forth, and bid the Deep<br/>
Within appointed bounds be heaven and earth.<br/>
Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill<br/>
Infinitude; nor vacuous the space,<br/>
Though I, uncircumscribed, myself retire,<br/>
And put not forth my goodness, which is free<br/>
To act or not. Necessity and Chance<br/>
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.'

"So spake the Almighty; and to what he spake<br/>
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.<br/>
Immediate are the acts of God, more swift<br/>
Than time or motion, but to human ears<br/>
Cannot without process' of speech be told,<br/>
So told as earthly notion can receive.<br/>
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven<br/>
When such was heard declared the Almighty's will.<br/>
Glory they sung to the Most High, goodwill<br/>
To future men, and in their dwellings peace—<br/>
Glory to Him whose just avenging ire<br/>
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight<br/>
And the habitations of the just; to Him<br/>
Glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained<br/>
Good out of evil to create-instead<br/>
Of Spirits malign, a better Race to bring<br/>
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse<br/>
His good to worlds and ages infinite.

"So sang the Hierarchies. Meanwhile the Son<br/>
On his great expedition now appeared,<br/>
Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned<br/>
Of majesty divine, sapience and love<br/>
Immense; and all his Father in him shon.<br/>
About his chariot numberless were poured<br/>
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,<br/>
And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged<br/>
From the armoury of God, where stand of old<br/>
Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged<br/>
Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,<br/>
Celestial equipage; and now came forth<br/>
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,<br/>
Attendant on their Lord. Heaven opened wide<br/>
Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound<br/>
On golden hinges moving, to let forth<br/>
The King of Glory, in his powerful Word<br/>
And Spirit coming to create new worlds.<br/>
On Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore<br/>
They viewed the vast immeasurable Abyss,<br/>
Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,<br/>
Up from the bottom turned by furious winds<br/>
And surging waves, as mountains to assault<br/>
Heaven's highth, and with the centre mix the pole.

"'Silence, ye troubled waves, and, thou Deep, peace!'<br/>
Said then the omnific Word: 'your discord end!'<br/>
Nor stayed; but, on the wings of Cherubim<br/>
Uplifted, in paternal glory rode<br/>
Far into Chaos and the World unborn;<br/>
For Chaos heard his voice. Him all his train<br/>
Followed in bright procession, to behold<br/>
Creation, and the wonders of his might.<br/>
Then stayed the fervid wheels, and in his hand<br/>
He took the golden compasses, prepared<br/>
In God's eternal store, to circumscribe<br/>
This Universe, and all created things.<br/>
One foot he centred, and the other turned<br/>
Round through the vast profundity obscure,<br/>
And said, 'Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds;<br/>
This be thy just circumference, O World!<br/>
Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,<br/>
Matter unformed and void. Darkness profound<br/>
Covered the Abyss; but on the watery calm<br/>
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,<br/>
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth,<br/>
Throughout the fluid mass, but downward purged<br/>
The black, tartareous, cold, infernal dregs,<br/>
Adverse to life; then founded, then conglobed,<br/>
Like things to like, the rest to several place<br/>
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,<br/>
And Earth, self-balanced, on her centre hung.

"'Let there be Light!" said God; and forthwith Light<br/>
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,<br/>
Sprung from the Deep, and from her native East<br/>
To journey through the aery gloom began,<br/>
Sphered in a radiant cloud-for yet the Sun<br/>
Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle<br/>
Sojourned the while. God saw the Light was good;<br/>
And light from darkness by the hemisphere<br/>
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night,<br/>
He named. Thus was the first Day even and morn;<br/>
Nor passed uncelebrated, nor unsung<br/>
By the celestial quires, when orient light<br/>
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld,<br/>
Birth-day of Heaven and Earth. With joy and shout<br/>
The hollow universal orb they filled,<br/>
And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised<br/>
God and his works; Creator him they sung,<br/>
Both when first evening was, and when first morn.

"Again God said, 'Let there be firmament<br/>
Amid the waters, and let it divide<br/>
The waters from the waters!' And God made<br/>
The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br/>
Transparent, elemental air, diffused<br/>
In circuit to the uttermost convex<br/>
Of this great round-partition firm and sure,<br/>
The waters underneath from those above<br/>
Dividing; for as Earth, so he the World<br/>
Built on cicumfluous waters calm, in wide<br/>
Crystallin ocean, and the loud misrule<br/>
Of Chaos far removed, lest fierce extremes<br/>
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:<br/>
And Heaven he named the Firmament. So even<br/>
And morning chorus sung the second Day.

"The Earth was formed, but, in the womb as yet<br/>
Of waters, embryon immature, involved,<br/>
Appeared not; over all the face of Earth<br/>
Main ocean flowed, not idle, but, with warm<br/>
Prolific humour softening all her globe,<br/>
Fermented the great Mother to conceive,<br/>
Satiate with genial moisture; when God said,<br/>
'Be gathered now, ye waters under heaven,<br/>
Into one place, and let dry land appear!'<br/>
Immediately the mountains huge appear<br/>
Emergent, and their broad bare backs upheave<br/>
Into the clouds; their tops ascend the sky.<br/>
So high as heaved the tumid hills, so low<br/>
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,<br/>
Capacious bed of waters. Thither they<br/>
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowled,<br/>
As drops on dust conglobing, from the dry:<br/>
Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,<br/>
For haste; such flight the great command impressed<br/>
On the swift floods. As armies at the call<br/>
Of trumpet (for of armies thou hast heard)<br/>
Troop to their standard, so the watery throng,<br/>
Wave rowling after wave, where way they found—<br/>
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,<br/>
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them rock or hill;<br/>
But they, or underground, or circuit wide<br/>
With serpent error wandering, found their way,<br/>
And on the washy ooze deep channels wore:<br/>
Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,<br/>
All but within those banks where rivers now<br/>
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.<br/>
The dry land Earth, and the great receptacle<br/>
Of congregated waters he called Seas;<br/>
And saw that it was good, and said, 'Let the Earth<br/>
Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,<br/>
And fruit-tree yielding fruit after her kind,<br/>
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth!'<br/>
He scarce had said when the bare Earth, till then<br/>
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorned,<br/>
Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad<br/>
Her universal face with pleasant green;<br/>
Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered,<br/>
Opening their various colours, and made gay<br/>
Her bosom, smelling sweet; and, these scarce blown,<br/>
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept<br/>
The smelling gourd, up stood the corny reed<br/>
Imbattled in her field: add the humble shrub,<br/>
And bush with frizzled hair implicit: last<br/>
Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread<br/>
Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed<br/>
Their blossoms. With high woods the hills were crowned,<br/>
With tufts the valleys and each fountain-side,<br/>
With borders long the rivers, that Earth now<br/>
Seemed like to Heaven, a seat where gods might dwell,<br/>
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt<br/>
Her sacred shades; though God had yet not rained<br/>
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground<br/>
None was, but from the Earth a dewy mist<br/>
Went up and watered all the ground, and each<br/>
Plant of the field, which ere it was in the Earth<br/>
God made, and every herb before it grew<br/>
On the green stem. God saw that it was good;<br/>
So even and morn recorded the third Day.

"Again the Almighty spake, 'Let there be Lights<br/>
High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide<br/>
The Day from Night; and let them be for signs,<br/>
For seasons, and for days, and circling years;<br/>
And let them be for lights, as I ordain<br/>
Their office in the firmament of heaven,<br/>
To give light on the Earth!' and it was so.<br/>
And God made two great Lights, great for their use<br/>
To Man, the greater to have rule by day,<br/>
The less by night, alternor; and made the Stars,<br/>
And set them in the firmament of heaven<br/>
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day<br/>
In their vicissitude, and rule the night,<br/>
And light from darkness to divide. God saw,<br/>
Surveying his great work, that it was good:<br/>
For, of celestial bodies, first the Sun<br/>
A mighty sphere he framed, unlightsome first,<br/>
Though of ethereal mould; then formed the Moon<br/>
Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,<br/>
And sowed with stars the heaven thick as a field.<br/>
Of light by far the greater part he took,<br/>
Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed<br/>
In the Sun's orb, made porous to receive<br/>
And drink the liquid light, firm to retain<br/>
Her gathered beams, great palace now of Light.<br/>
Hither, as to their fountain, other stars<br/>
Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,<br/>
And hence the morning planet gilds her horns;<br/>
By tincture or reflection they augment<br/>
Their small peculiar, though, from human sight<br/>
So far remote, with diminution seen.<br/>
First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,<br/>
Regent of day, and all the horizon round<br/>
Invested with bright rays, jocond to run<br/>
His longitude through heaven's high-road; the grey<br/>
Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,<br/>
Shedding sweet influence. Less bright the Moon,<br/>
But opposite in levelled west, was set,<br/>
His mirror, with full face borrowing her light<br/>
From him; for other light she needed none<br/>
In that aspect, and still that distance keeps<br/>
Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,<br/>
Revolved on heaven's great axle, and her reign<br/>
With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,<br/>
With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared<br/>
Spangling the hemisphere. Then first adorned<br/>
With her bright luminaries, that set and rose,<br/>
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth Day.

"And God said, 'Let the waters generate<br/>
Reptile with spawn abundant, living soul;<br/>
And let Fowl fly above the earth, with wings<br/>
Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven!'<br/>
And God created the great Whales, and each<br/>
Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously<br/>
The waters generated by their kinds,<br/>
And every bird of wing after his kind,<br/>
And saw that it was good, and blessed them, saying,<br/>
'Be fruitful, multiply, and, in the seas,<br/>
And lakes, and running streams, the waters fill;<br/>
And let the fowl be multiplied on the earth!'<br/>
Forthwith the sounds and seas, each creek and bay,<br/>
With fry innumerable swarm, and shoals<br/>
Of fish that, with their fins and shining scales,<br/>
Glide under the green wave in sculls that oft<br/>
Bank the mid-sea. Part, single or with mate,<br/>
Graze the sea-weed, their pasture, and through groves<br/>
Of coral stray, or, sporting with quick glance,<br/>
Shew to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold,<br/>
Or, in their pearly shells at ease, attend<br/>
Moist nutriment, or under rocks their food<br/>
In jointed armour watch; on smooth the seal<br/>
And bended dolphins play; part, huge of bulk,<br/>
Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait,<br/>
Tempest the ocean. There Leviathan,<br/>
Hugest of living creatures, on the deep<br/>
Stretched like a promontory, sleeps or swims,<br/>
And seems a moving land, and at his gills<br/>
Draws in, and at his trunk spouts out, a sea.<br/>
Meanwhile the tepid caves, and fens, and shores,<br/>
Their brood as numerous hatch from the egg, that soon,<br/>
Bursting with kindly rupture, forth disclosed<br/>
Their callow young; but feathered soon and fledge<br/>
They summed their pens, and, soaring the air sublime,<br/>
With clang despised the ground, under a cloud<br/>
In prospect. There the eagle and the stork<br/>
On cliffs and cedar-tops their eyries build.<br/>
Part loosely wing the Region; part, more wise,<br/>
In common, ranged in figure, wedge their way,<br/>
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth<br/>
Their aerie caravan, high over seas<br/>
Flying, and over lands, with mutual wing<br/>
Easing their flight: so steers the prudent crane<br/>
Her annual voyage, borne on winds: the air<br/>
Floats as they pass, fanned with unnumbered plumes.<br/>
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song<br/>
Solaced the woods, and spread their painted wings,<br/>
Till even; nor then the solemn nightingale<br/>
Ceased warbling, but all night tuned her soft lays.<br/>
Others, on silver lakes and rivers, bathed<br/>
Their downy breast; the swan, with arched neck<br/>
Between her white wings mantling proudly, rows<br/>
Her state with oary feet; yet oft they quit<br/>
The dank, and, rising on stiff pennons, tower<br/>
The mid aerial sky. Others on ground<br/>
Walked firm-the crested cock, whose clarion sounds<br/>
The silent hours, and the other, whose gay train<br/>
Adorns him, coloured with the florid hue<br/>
Of rainbows and starry eyes. The waters thus<br/>
With Fish replenished, and the air with Fowl,<br/>
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth Day.

"The sixth, and of Creation last, arose<br/>
With evening harps and matin; when God said,<br/>
'Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind,<br/>
Cattle, and creeping things, and beast of the earth,<br/>
Each in their kind!' The Earth obeyed, and, straight<br/>
Opening her fertile womb, teemed at a birth<br/>
Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,<br/>
Limbed and full-grown. Out of the ground up rose,<br/>
As from his lair, the wild beast, where he wons<br/>
In forest wild, in thicket, brake, or den—<br/>
Among the trees in pairs they rose, they walked;<br/>
The cattle in the fields and meadows green:<br/>
Those rare and solitary, these in flocks<br/>
Pasturing at once and in broad herds, upsprung.<br/>
The grassy clods now calved; now half appeared<br/>
The tawny Lion, pawing to get free<br/>
His hinder parts-then springs, as broke from bonds,<br/>
And rampant shakes his brinded mane; the Ounce,<br/>
The Libbard, and the Tiger, as the Mole<br/>
Rising, the crumbled earth above them threw<br/>
In hillocks; the swift Stag from underground<br/>
Bore up his branching head; scarce from his mould<br/>
Behemoth, biggest born of earth, upheaved<br/>
His vastness; fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,<br/>
As plants; ambiguous between sea and land,<br/>
The River-horse and scaly Crocodile.<br/>
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,<br/>
Insect or worm. Those waved their limber fans<br/>
For wings, and smallest lineaments exact<br/>
In all the liveries decked of summer's pride,<br/>
With spots of gold and purple, azure and green;<br/>
These as a line their long dimension drew,<br/>
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace: not all<br/>
Minims of nature; some of serpent kind,<br/>
Wondrous in length and corpulence, involved<br/>
Their snaky folds, and added wings. First crept<br/>
The parsimonious Emmet, provident<br/>
Of future, in small room large heart enclosed—<br/>
Pattern of just equality perhaps<br/>
Hereafter-joined in her popular tribes<br/>
Of commonalty. Swarming next appeared<br/>
The female Bee, that feeds her husband drone<br/>
Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells<br/>
With honey stored. The rest are numberless,<br/>
And thou their natures know'st, and gav'st them names<br/>
Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown<br/>
The Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,<br/>
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes<br/>
And hairy mane terrific, though to thee<br/>
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.

"Now Heaven in all her glory shon, and rowled<br/>
Her motions, as the great First Mover's hand<br/>
First wheeled their course; Earth, in her rich attire<br/>
Consummate, lovely smiled; Air, Water, Earth,<br/>
By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked<br/>
Frequent; and of the sixth Day yet remained.<br/>
There wanted yet the master-work, the end<br/>
Of all yet done-a creature who, not prone<br/>
And brute as other creatures, but endued<br/>
With sanctity of reason, might erect<br/>
His stature, and, upright with front serene<br/>
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence<br/>
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,<br/>
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br/>
Descends; thither with heart, and voice, and eyes<br/>
Directed in devotion, to adore<br/>
And worship God Supreme, who made him chief<br/>
Of all his works. Therefore the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father (for where is not He<br/>
Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake:—<br/>
'Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br/>
In our Timilitude, and let them rule<br/>
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air,<br/>
Beast of the field, and over all the earth,<br/>
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground!'<br/>
This said, he formed thee, Adam, thee, O Man,<br/>
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed<br/>
The breath of life; in his own image he<br/>
Created thee, in the image of God<br/>
Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul.<br/>
Male he created thee, but thy consort'<br/>
Female, for race; then blessed mankind, and said,<br/>
'Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth;<br/>
Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold<br/>
Over fish of the sea and fowl of the air,<br/>
And every living thing that moves on the Earth!<br/>
Wherever thus created-for no place<br/>
Is yet distinct by name-thence, as thou know'st,<br/>
He brought thee into this delicious grove,<br/>
This Garden, planted with the tress of God,<br/>
Delectable both to behold and taste,<br/>
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food<br/>
Gave thee. All sorts are here that all the earth yields,<br/>
Variety without end; but of the tree<br/>
Which tasted works knowledge of good and evil<br/>
Thou may'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou diest.<br/>
Death is the penalty imposed; beware,<br/>
And govern well thy appetite, least Sin<br/>
Surprise thee, and her black attendant, Death.

"Here finished He, and all that he had made<br/>
Viewed, and behold! all was entirely good.<br/>
So even and morn accomplished the sixth Day;<br/>
Yet not till the Creator, from his work<br/>
Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,<br/>
Up to the Heaven of Heavens, his high abode,<br/>
Thence to behold this new-created World,<br/>
The addition of his empire, how it shewed<br/>
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how fair,<br/>
Answering his great Idea. Up he rode,<br/>
Followed with acclamation, and the sound<br/>
Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned<br/>
Angelic harmonies. The Earth, the Air<br/>
Resounded (thou remember'st, for thou heard'st),<br/>
The heavens and all the constellations rung,<br/>
The planets in their stations listening stood,<br/>
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.<br/>
'Open, ye everlasting gates!' they sung;<br/>
'Open, ye Heavens, your living doors! let in<br/>
The great Creator, from his work returned<br/>
Magnificent, his six days' work, a World!<br/>
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign<br/>
To visit oft the dwellings of just men<br/>
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse<br/>
Thither will send his winged messengers<br/>
On errands of supernal grace.' So sung<br/>
The glorious train ascending. He through Heaven,<br/>
That opened wide her blazing portals, led<br/>
To God's eternal house direct the way—<br/>
A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,<br/>
And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear<br/>
Seen in the Galaxy, that milky way<br/>
Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest<br/>
Powdered with stars. And now on Earth the seventh<br/>
Evening arose in Eden-for the sun<br/>
Was set, and twilight from the east came on,<br/>
Forerunning night-when at the holy mount<br/>
Of Heaven's high-seated top, the imperial throne<br/>
Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,<br/>
The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down<br/>
With his great Father; for He also went<br/>
Invisible, yet stayed (such privilege<br/>
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordained,<br/>
Author and end of all things, and from work<br/>
Now resting. Blessed and hallowed the seventh Day,<br/>
As resting on that day from all his work;<br/>
But not in silence holy kept: the harp<br/>
Had work, and rested not; the solemn pipe<br/>
And dulcimer, all organs of sweet stop,<br/>
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire,<br/>
Tempered soft tunings, intermixed with voice<br/>
Choral or unison; of incense clouds,<br/>
Fuming from golden censers, hid the Mount.<br/>
Creation and the Six Days' acts they sung:—<br/>
'Great are thy works, Jehovah! infinite<br/>
Thy power! what thought can measure thee, or tongue<br/>
Relate thee-greater now in thy return<br/>
Than from the Giant-angels? Thee that day<br/>
Thy thunders magnified; but to create<br/>
Is greater than created to destroy.<br/>
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound<br/>
Thy empire? Easily the proud attempt<br/>
Of Spirits apostate, and their counsels vain,<br/>
Thou hast repelled, while impiously they thought<br/>
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw<br/>
The number of thy worshipers. Who seeks<br/>
To lessen thee, against his purpose, serves<br/>
To manifest the more thy might; his evil<br/>
Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.<br/>
Witness this new-made World, another Heaven<br/>
From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view<br/>
On the clear hyalin, the glassy sea;<br/>
Of amplitude almost immense, with stars<br/>
Numerous, and every star perhaps a world<br/>
Of destined habitation-but thou know'st<br/>
Their seasons; among these the seat of men,<br/>
Earth, with her nether ocean circumfused,<br/>
Their pleasant dwelling-place. Thrice happy men,<br/>
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanced,<br/>
Created in his image, there to dwell<br/>
And worship him, and in reward to rule<br/>
Over his works, on earth, in sea, or air,<br/>
And multiply a race of worshipers<br/>
Holy and just! thrice happy, if they know<br/>
Their happiness, and persevere upright!'

"So sung they, and the Empyrean rung<br/>
With halleluiahs. Thus was Sabbath kept.<br/>
And thy request think now fulfilled that asked<br/>
How first this World and face of things began,<br/>
And what before thy memory was done<br/>
From the beginning, that posterity,<br/>
Informed by thee, might know. If else thou seek'st<br/>
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say."

<h2>Book 8</h2>

The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear<br/>
So charming left his voice that he a while<br/>
Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;<br/>
Then, as new-waked, thus gratefully replied:—

"What thanks sufficient, or what recompense<br/>
Equal, have I to render thee, divine<br/>
Historian, who thus largely hast allayed<br/>
The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsafed<br/>
This friendly condescension to relate<br/>
Things else by me unsearchable-now heard<br/>
With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,<br/>
With glory attributed to the high<br/>
Creator? Something yet of doubt remains,<br/>
Which only thy solution can resolve.<br/>
When I behold this goodly frame, this World,<br/>
Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute<br/>
Their magnitudes-this Earth, a spot, a grain,<br/>
An atom, with the Firmament compared<br/>
And all her numbered stars, that seem to rowl<br/>
Spaces incomprehensible (for such<br/>
Their distance argues, and their swift return<br/>
Diurnal) merely to officiate light<br/>
Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,<br/>
One day and night, in all their vast survey<br/>
Useless besides-reasoning, I oft admire<br/>
How Nature, wise and frugal, could commit<br/>
Such disproportions, with superfluous hand<br/>
So many nobler bodies to create,<br/>
Greater so manifold, to this one use,<br/>
For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose<br/>
Such restless revolution day by day<br/>
Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,<br/>
That better might with far less compass move,<br/>
Served by more noble than herself, attains<br/>
Her end without least motion, and receives,<br/>
As tribute, such a sumless journey brought<br/>
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light:<br/>
Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails."

So spake our Sire, and by his countenance seemed<br/>
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve<br/>
Perceiving, where, she sat retired in sight,<br/>
With lowliness majestic from her seat,<br/>
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,<br/>
Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,<br/>
To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,<br/>
Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,<br/>
And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.<br/>
Yet went she not as not with such discourse<br/>
Delighted, or not capable her ear<br/>
Of what was high. Such pleasure she reserved,<br/>
Adam relating, she sole auditress;<br/>
Her husband the relater she preferred<br/>
Before the Angel, and of him to ask<br/>
Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix<br/>
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br/>
With conjugal caresses: from his lip<br/>
Not words alone pleased her. Oh, when meet now<br/>
Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?<br/>
With goddess-like demeanour forth she went,<br/>
Not unattended; for on her as Queen<br/>
A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br/>
And from about her shot darts of desire<br/>
Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.<br/>
And Raphael now to Adam's doubt proposed<br/>
Benevolent and facile thus replied:—

"To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heaven<br/>
Is as the Book of God before thee set,<br/>
Wherein to read his wondrous works, and learn<br/>
His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years.<br/>
This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth<br/>
Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest<br/>
From Man or Angel the great Architect<br/>
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br/>
His secrets, to be scanned by them who ought<br/>
Rather admire. Or, if they list to try<br/>
Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heavens<br/>
Hath left to their disputes-perhaps to move<br/>
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br/>
Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven,<br/>
And calculate the stars; how they will wield<br/>
The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive<br/>
To save appearances; how gird the Sphere<br/>
With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er,<br/>
Cycle and Epicycle, orb in orb.<br/>
Already by thy reasoning this I guess,<br/>
Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest<br/>
That bodies bright and greater should not serve<br/>
The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,<br/>
Earth sitting still, when she alone receives<br/>
The benefit. Consider, first, that great<br/>
Or bright infers not excellence. The Earth,<br/>
Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,<br/>
Nor glistering, may of solid good contain<br/>
More plenty than the Sun that barren shines,<br/>
Whose virtue on itself works no effect,<br/>
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receivod,<br/>
His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.<br/>
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries<br/>
Officious, but to thee, Earth's habitant.<br/>
And, for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak<br/>
The Maker's high magnificence, who built<br/>
So spacious, and his line stretched out so far,<br/>
That Man may know he dwells not in his own—<br/>
An edifice too large for him to fill,<br/>
Lodged in a small partition, and the rest<br/>
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.<br/>
The swiftness of those Circles at'tribute,<br/>
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br/>
That to corporeal substances could add<br/>
Speed almost spiritual. Me thou think'st not slow,<br/>
Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven<br/>
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived<br/>
In Eden-distance inexpressible<br/>
By numbers that have name. But this I urge,<br/>
Admitting motion in the Heavens, to shew<br/>
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;<br/>
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br/>
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br/>
God, to remove his ways from human sense,<br/>
Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,<br/>
If it presume, might err in things too high,<br/>
And no advantage gain. What if the Sun<br/>
Be centre to the World, and other Stars,<br/>
By his attractive virtue and their own<br/>
Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br/>
Their wandering course, now high, now low, then hid,<br/>
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br/>
In six thou seest; and what if, seventh to these<br/>
The planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,<br/>
Insensibly three different motions move?<br/>
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,<br/>
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,<br/>
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift<br/>
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,<br/>
Invisible else above all stars, the wheel<br/>
Of Day and Night; which needs not they belief,<br/>
If Earth, industrious of herself, fetch Day,<br/>
Travelling east, and with her part averse<br/>
From the Sun's beam meet Night, her other part<br/>
Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,<br/>
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,<br/>
To the terrestrial Moon to be as a star,<br/>
Enlightening her by day, as she by night<br/>
This Earth-reciprocal, if land be there,<br/>
Fields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest<br/>
As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce<br/>
Fruits in her softened soil, for some to eat<br/>
Allotted there; and other Suns, perhaps,<br/>
With their attendant Moons, thou wilt descry,<br/>
Communicating male and female light—<br/>
Which to great sexes animate the World,<br/>
Stored in each Orb perhaps with some that live.<br/>
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed<br/>
By living soul, desert and desolate,<br/>
Only to shine, yet scarce to con'tribute<br/>
Each Orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far<br/>
Down to this habitable, which returns<br/>
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br/>
But whether thus these things, or whether not—<br/>
Whether the Sun, predominant in heaven,<br/>
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun;<br/>
He from the east his flaming road begin,<br/>
Or she from west her silent course advance<br/>
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br/>
On her soft axle, while she paces even,<br/>
And bears thee soft with the smooth air along—<br/>
Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid:<br/>
Leave them to God above; him serve and fear.<br/>
Of other creatures as him pleases best,<br/>
Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou<br/>
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br/>
And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high<br/>
To know what passes there. Be lowly wise;<br/>
Think only what concerns thee and thy being;<br/>
Dream not to other worlds, what creatures there<br/>
Live, in what state, condition, or degreed-<br/>
Contented that thus far hath been revealed<br/>
Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven."

To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied:—<br/>
"How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure<br/>
Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene,<br/>
And, freed from intricacies, taught to live<br/>
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts<br/>
To interrupt the sweet of life, from which<br/>
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,<br/>
And not molest us, unless we ourselves<br/>
Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain!<br/>
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove<br/>
Unchecked; and of her roving is no end,<br/>
Till, warned, or by experience taught, she learn<br/>
That not to know at large of things remote<br/>
From use, obscure and subtle, but to know<br/>
That which before us lies in daily life,<br/>
Is the prime wisdom: what is more is fume,<br/>
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,<br/>
And renders us in things that most concern<br/>
Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.<br/>
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br/>
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br/>
Useful; whence, haply, mentiin may arise<br/>
Of something not unreasonable to ask,<br/>
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.<br/>
Thee I have heard relating what was done<br/>
Ere my remembrance; now hear me relate<br/>
My story, which perhaps, thou hast not heard.<br/>
And day is yet not spent; till then thou seest<br/>
How subtly to detain thee I devise,<br/>
Inviting thee to hear while I relate—<br/>
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply.<br/>
For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;<br/>
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear<br/>
Than fruits of palm-tree, pleasantest to thirst<br/>
And hunger both, from labour, at the hour<br/>
Of sweet repast. They satiate, and soon fill,<br/>
Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine<br/>
Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety."

To whom thus Raphael answered, heavenly meek:—<br/>
"Nor are thy lips ungrateful, Sire of Men,<br/>
Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee<br/>
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured,<br/>
Inward and outward both, his image fair:<br/>
Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace<br/>
Attends thee, and each word, each motion, forms.<br/>
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth<br/>
Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire<br/>
Gladly into the ways of God with Man;<br/>
For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set<br/>
On Man his equal love. Say therefore on;<br/>
For I that day was absent, as befell,<br/>
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br/>
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell,<br/>
Squared in full legion (such command we had),<br/>
To see that none thence issued forth a spy<br/>
Or enemy, while God was in his work,<br/>
Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,<br/>
Destruction with Creation might have mixed.<br/>
Not that they durst without his leave attempt;<br/>
But us he sends upon his high behests<br/>
For state, as sovran King, and to inure<br/>
Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut,<br/>
The dismal gates, and barricaded strong,<br/>
But, long ere our approaching, heard within<br/>
Noise, other than the sound of dance or song—<br/>
Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.<br/>
Glad we returned up to the coasts of Light<br/>
Ere Sabbath-evening; so we had in charge.<br/>
But thy relation now: for I attend,<br/>
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine."

So spake the godlike Power, and thus our Sire:—<br/>
"For Man to tell how human life began<br/>
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?<br/>
Desire with thee still longer to converse<br/>
Induced me. As new-waked from soundest sleep,<br/>
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,<br/>
In balmy sweat, which with his beams the Sun<br/>
Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.<br/>
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,<br/>
And gazed a while the ample sky, till, raised<br/>
By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,<br/>
As thitherward endeavoring, and upright<br/>
Stood on my feet. About me round I saw<br/>
Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,<br/>
And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,<br/>
Creatures that lived and moved, and walked or flew,<br/>
Birds on the branches warbling: all things smiled;<br/>
With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.<br/>
Myself I then perused, and limb by limb<br/>
Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br/>
With supple joints, as lively vigour led;<br/>
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br/>
Knew not. To speak I tried, and forthwith spake;<br/>
My tongue obeyed, and readily could name<br/>
Whate'er I saw. 'Thou Sun,' said I, 'fair light,<br/>
And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,<br/>
Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, woods, and plains,<br/>
And ye that live and move, fair creatures, tell,<br/>
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here!<br/>
Not of myself; by some great Maker then,<br/>
tin goodness and in power prae-eminent.<br/>
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br/>
From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br/>
And feel that I am happier than I know!'<br/>
While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,<br/>
From where I first drew air, and first beheld<br/>
This happy light, when answer none returned,<br/>
On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,<br/>
Pensive I sat me down. There gentle sleep<br/>
First found me, and with soft oppression seized<br/>
My drowsed sense, untroubled, though I thought<br/>
I then was passing to my former state<br/>
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br/>
When suddenly stood at my head a Dream,<br/>
Whose inward apparition gently moved<br/>
My fancy to believe I yet had being,<br/>
And lived. One came, methought, of shape divine,<br/>
And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,<br/>
First Man, of men innumerable ordained<br/>
First father! called by thee, I come thy guide<br/>
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'<br/>
So saying, by the hand he took me, raised,<br/>
And over fields and waters, as in air<br/>
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up<br/>
A woody mountain, whose high top was plain,<br/>
A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees<br/>
Planted, with walks and bowers, that what I saw<br/>
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree<br/>
Loaden with fairest fruit, that hung to the eye<br/>
Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite<br/>
To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found<br/>
Before mine eyes all real, as the dream<br/>
Had lively shadowed. Here had new begun<br/>
My wandering, had not He who was my guide<br/>
Up hither from among the trees appeared,<br/>
Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe,<br/>
In adoration at his feet I fell<br/>
Submiss. He reared me, and, 'Whom thou sought'st I am,'<br/>
Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest<br/>
Above, or round about thee, or beneath.<br/>
This Paradise I give thee; count it thine<br/>
To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat.<br/>
Of every tree that in the Garden grows<br/>
Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth.<br/>
But of the tree whose operation brings<br/>
Knowledge of Good and Ill, which I have set,<br/>
The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,<br/>
Amid the garden by the Tree of Life—<br/>
Remember what I warn thee-shun to taste,<br/>
And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br/>
The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command<br/>
Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,<br/>
From that day mortal, and this happy state<br/>
Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world<br/>
Of woe and sorrow.' Sternly he pronounced<br/>
The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br/>
Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice<br/>
Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect'<br/>
Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed:—<br/>
'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br/>
To thee and to thy race I give; as lords<br/>
Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br/>
Or live in sea or air, beast, fish, and fowl.<br/>
In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold<br/>
After their kinds; I bring them to receive<br/>
From thee their names, and pay thee fealty<br/>
With low subjection. Understand the same<br/>
Of fish within their watery residence,<br/>
Not hither summoned, since they cannot change<br/>
Their element to draw the thinner air.'<br/>
As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold<br/>
Approaching two and two-these cowering low<br/>
With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.<br/>
I named them as they passed, and understood<br/>
Their nature; with such knowledge God endued<br/>
My sudden apprehension. But in these<br/>
I found not what methought I wanted still,<br/>
And to the Heavenly Vision thus presumed:—

"'O, by what name-or Thou above all these,<br/>
Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,<br/>
Surpassestwfar my naming-how may I<br/>
Adore thee, Author of this Universe,<br/>
And all this good to Man, for whose well-being<br/>
So amply, and with hands so liberal,<br/>
Thou hast provided all things? But with me<br/>
I see not who partakes. In solitude<br/>
What happiness? who can enjoy alone,<br/>
Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?'<br/>
Thus I, presumptuous; and the Vision bright,<br/>
As with a smile more brightened, thus replied:—

"'What call'st thou solitude? Is not the Earth<br/>
With various living creatures, and the Air,<br/>
Replenished, and all these at thy command<br/>
To come and play before thee? Know'st thou not<br/>
Their language and their ways? They also know,<br/>
And reason not contemptibly; with these<br/>
Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.'<br/>
So spake the Universal Lord and seemed<br/>
So ordering. I, with leave of speech implored,<br/>
And humble deprecation, thus replied:—

"'Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;<br/>
My Maker, be propitious while I speak.<br/>
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,<br/>
And these inferior far beneath me set?<br/>
Among unequals what society<br/>
Can sort, what harmony or true delight?<br/>
Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br/>
Given and received; but, in disparity,<br/>
The one intense, the other still remiss,<br/>
Clnnot well suit with either, but soon prove<br/>
Tedious alike. Of fellowship I speak<br/>
Such as I seek, fit to participate<br/>
All rational delight, wherein the brute<br/>
Cannot be human consort. They rejoice<br/>
Each with their kind, lion with lioness;<br/>
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:<br/>
Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl,<br/>
So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;<br/>
Worse, then, can man with beast, and least of all.'

"Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased:—<br/>
'A nice and subtle happiness, I see,<br/>
Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice<br/>
Of thy associates, Adam, and wilt taste<br/>
No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.<br/>
What think'st thou, then, of Me, and this my state?<br/>
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed<br/>
Of happiness, or not, who am alone<br/>
From all eternity? for none I know<br/>
Second to me or like, equal much less.<br/>
How have I, then, with whom to hold converse,<br/>
Save with the creatures which I made, and those<br/>
To me inferior infinite descents<br/>
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?'

"He ceased. I lowly answered:—'To attain<br/>
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways<br/>
All human thoughts come short, Supreme of Things!<br/>
Thou in thyself art perfect, and in Thee<br/>
Is no deficience found. Not so is Man,<br/>
But in degree-the cause of his desire<br/>
By conversation with his like to help<br/>
Or solace his defects. No need that thou<br/>
Should'st propagate, already infinite,<br/>
And through all numbers absolute, though One;<br/>
But Man by number is to manifest<br/>
His single imperfection, and beget<br/>
Like of his like, his image multiplied,<br/>
In unity defective; which requires<br/>
Collateral love, and dearest amity.<br/>
Thou, in thy secrecy although alone,<br/>
Best with thyself accompanied, seek'st not<br/>
Social communication-yet, so pleased,<br/>
Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt<br/>
Of union or communion, deified;<br/>
I, by conversing, cannot these erect<br/>
From prone, nor in their ways complacence find.<br/>
Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used<br/>
Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained<br/>
This answer from the gratious Voice Divine:—

"'Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased,<br/>
And find thee knowing not of beasts alone,<br/>
Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself—<br/>
Expressing well the spirit within thee free,<br/>
My image, not imparted to the brute;<br/>
Whose fellowship, therefore, unmeet for thee,<br/>
Good Reason was thou freely shouldst dislike.<br/>
And be so minded still. I, ere thou spak'st,<br/>
Knew it not good for Man to be alone,<br/>
And no such company as then thou saw'st<br/>
Intended thee-for trial only brought,<br/>
To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet.<br/>
What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,<br/>
Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,<br/>
Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.'

"He ended, or I heard no more; for now<br/>
My earthly, by his heavenly overpowered,<br/>
Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth<br/>
In that celestial colloquy sublime,<br/>
As with an object that excels the sense,<br/>
Dazzled and spent, sunk down, and sought repair<br/>
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called<br/>
By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.<br/>
Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell<br/>
Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,<br/>
Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,<br/>
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the Shape<br/>
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;<br/>
Who, stooping, opened my left side, and took<br/>
From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,<br/>
And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br/>
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed.<br/>
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;<br/>
Under his forming hands a creature grew,<br/>
Man-like, but different sex, so lovely fair<br/>
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now<br/>
Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained<br/>
And in her looks, which from that time infused<br/>
Sweetness into my heart unfelt before,<br/>
And into all things from her air inspired<br/>
The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br/>
She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked<br/>
To find her, or for ever to deplore<br/>
Her loss, and other pleasures all adjure:<br/>
When, out of hope, behold her not far off,<br/>
Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned<br/>
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br/>
To make her amiable. On she came,<br/>
Led by her Heavenly Maker, though unseen<br/>
And guided by his voice, nor uninformed<br/>
Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites.<br/>
Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,<br/>
In every gesture dignity and love.<br/>
I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud:—

"'This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled<br/>
Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,<br/>
Giver of all things fair-but fairest this<br/>
Of all thy gifts!-nor enviest. I now see<br/>
Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, my Self<br/>
Before me. Woman is her name, of Man<br/>
Extracted; for this cause he shall forgo<br/>
Father and mother, and to his wife adhere,<br/>
And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.'

"She heard me thus; and, though divinely brought,<br/>
Yet innocence and virgin modesty,<br/>
Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br/>
That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,<br/>
Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired,<br/>
The most desirable-or, to say all,<br/>
Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought—<br/>
Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned.<br/>
I followed her; she what was honour knew,<br/>
And with obsequious majesty approved<br/>
My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower<br/>
I led her blushing like the Morn; all Heaven,<br/>
And happy constellations, on that hour<br/>
Shed their selectest influence; the Earth<br/>
Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;<br/>
Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs<br/>
Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings<br/>
Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,<br/>
Disporting, till the amorous bird of night<br/>
Sung spousal, and bid haste the Evening-star<br/>
On his hill-top to light the bridal lamp.

"Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought<br/>
My story to the sum of earthly bliss<br/>
Which I enjoy, and must confess to find<br/>
In all things else delight indeed, but such<br/>
As, use or not, works in the mind no change,<br/>
Nor vehement desire-these delicacies<br/>
I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,<br/>
Walks, and the melody of birds: but here,<br/>
Far otherwise, transported I behold,<br/>
Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br/>
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else<br/>
Superior and unmoved, here only weak<br/>
Against the charm of beauty's powerful glance.<br/>
Or Nature failed in me, and left some part<br/>
Not proof enough such object to sustain,<br/>
Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps<br/>
More than enough-at least on her bestowed<br/>
Too much of ornament, in outward show<br/>
Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br/>
For well I understand in the prime end<br/>
Of Nature her the inferior, in the mind<br/>
And inward faculties, which most excel;<br/>
In outward also her resembling less<br/>
His image who made both, and less expressing<br/>
The character of that dominion given<br/>
O'er other creatures. Yet when I approach<br/>
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br/>
And in herself complete, so well to know<br/>
Her own, that what she wills to do or say<br/>
Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.<br/>
All higher Knowledge in her presence falls<br/>
Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her<br/>
Loses, discountenanced, and like Folly shews;<br/>
Authority and Reason on her wait,<br/>
As one intended first, not after made<br/>
Occasionally; and, to consum'mate all,<br/>
Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat<br/>
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br/>
About her, as a guard angelic placed."

To whom the Angel, with contracted brow:—<br/>
"Accuse not Nature! she hath done her part;<br/>
Do thou but thine! and be not diffident<br/>
Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou<br/>
Dismiss not her, when most thou need'st her nigh,<br/>
By attribu'ting overmuch to things<br/>
Less excellent, as thou thyself perceiv'st.<br/>
For, what admir'st thou, what transports thee so?<br/>
An outside-fair, no doubt, and worthy well<br/>
Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;<br/>
Not thy subjection. Weigh with her thyself;<br/>
Then value. Oft-times nothing profits more<br/>
Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br/>
Well managed. Of that skill the more thou know'st,<br/>
The more she will acknowledge thee her head,<br/>
And to realities yield all her shows—<br/>
Made so adorn for thy delight the more,<br/>
So awful, that with honour thou may'st love<br/>
Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise<br/>
But, if the sense of touch, whereby mankind<br/>
Is propagated, seem such dear delight<br/>
Beyond all other, think the same voutsafed<br/>
To cattle and each beast; which would not be<br/>
To them made common and divulged, if aught<br/>
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue<br/>
The soul of Man, or passion in him move.<br/>
What higher in her society thou find'st<br/>
Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br/>
In loving thou dost well; in passion not,<br/>
Wherein true Love consists not. Love refines<br/>
The thoughts, and heart enlarges-hath his seat<br/>
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale<br/>
By which to Heavenly Love thou may'st ascend,<br/>
Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause<br/>
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found."

To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied:—<br/>
"Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught<br/>
In procreation, common to all kinds<br/>
(Though higher of the genial bed by far,<br/>
And with mysterious reverence, I deem),<br/>
So much delights me as those graceful acts,<br/>
Those thousand decencies, that daily flow<br/>
From all her words and actions, mixed with love<br/>
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned<br/>
Union of mind, or in us both one soul—<br/>
Harmony to behold in wedded pair<br/>
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.<br/>
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br/>
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,<br/>
Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br/>
Variously representing, yet, still free,<br/>
Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br/>
To love thou blam'st me not-for Love, thou say'st,<br/>
Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;<br/>
Bear with me, then, if lawful what I ask.<br/>
Love not the Heavenly Spirits, and how their love<br/>
Express they-by looks only, or do they mix<br/>
Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?"

To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed<br/>
Celestial rosy-red, Love's proper hue,<br/>
Answered:—"Let it suffice thee that thou know'st<br/>
Us happy, and without Love no happiness.<br/>
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st<br/>
(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy<br/>
In eminence, and obstacle find none<br/>
Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars.<br/>
Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,<br/>
Total they mix, union of pure with pure<br/>
Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need<br/>
As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.<br/>
But I can now no more: the parting Sun<br/>
Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles<br/>
Hesperean sets, my signal to depart.<br/>
Be strong, live happy, and love! but first of all<br/>
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep<br/>
His great command; take heed lest passion sway<br/>
Thy judgment to do aught which else free-will<br/>
Would not admit; thine and of all thy sons<br/>
The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!<br/>
I in thy persevering shall rejoice,<br/>
And all the Blest. Stand fast; to stand or fall<br/>
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.<br/>
Perfet within, no outward aid require;<br/>
And all temptation to transgress repel."

So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus<br/>
Followed with benediction:—"Since to part,<br/>
Go, Heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,<br/>
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!<br/>
Gentle to me and affable hath been<br/>
Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever<br/>
With grateful memory. Thou to Mankind<br/>
Be good and friendly still, and oft return!"

So parted they, the Angel up to Heaven<br/>
From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.

<h2>Book 9</h2>

No more of talk where God or Angel Guest<br/>
With Man, as with his friend, familiar used<br/>
To sit indulgent, and with him partake<br/>
Rural repast, permitting him to while<br/>
Venial discourse unblamed. I now must change<br/>
Those notes to tragic-foul distrust, and breach<br/>
Disloyal, on the part of man, revolt<br/>
And disobedience; on the part of Heaven,<br/>
Now alienated, distance and distaste,<br/>
Anger and just rebuke, and judgment given,<br/>
That brought into this World a world of woe,<br/>
Sin and her shadow Death, and Misery,<br/>
Death's harbinger. Sad task! yet argument<br/>
Not less but more heroic than the wrauth<br/>
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued<br/>
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall; or rage<br/>
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespoused;<br/>
Or Neptune's ire, or Juno's that so long<br/>
Perplexed the Greek, and Cytherea's son:<br/>
If answerable style I can obtain<br/>
Of my celestial Patroness, who deigns<br/>
Her nightly visitation unimplored,<br/>
And dictates to me slumbering, or inspires<br/>
Easy my unpremeditated verse,<br/>
Since first this subject for heroic song<br/>
Pleased me, long choosing and beginning late,<br/>
Not sedulous by nature to indite<br/>
Wars, hitherto the only argument<br/>
Heroic deemed, chief maistrie to dissect<br/>
With long and tedious havoc fabled knights<br/>
In battles feigned (the better fortitude<br/>
Of patience and heroic martyrdom<br/>
Unsung), or to describe races and games,<br/>
Or tilting furniture, emblazoned shields,<br/>
Impreses quaint, caparisons and steeds,<br/>
Bases and tinsel trappings, gorgeous knights<br/>
At joust and tournament; then marshalled feast<br/>
Served up in hall with sewers and seneshals:<br/>
The skill of artifice or office mean;<br/>
Not that which justly gives heroic name<br/>
To person or to poem! Me, of these<br/>
Nor skilled nor studious, higher argument<br/>
Remains, sufficient of itself to raise<br/>
That name, unless an age too late, or cold<br/>
Climat, or years, damp my intended wing<br/>
Depressed; and much they may if all be mine,<br/>
Not Hers who brings it nightly to my ear.

The Sun was sunk, and after him the Star<br/>
Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring<br/>
Twilight upon the Earth, short arbiter<br/>
'Twixt day and night, and now from end to end<br/>
Night's hemisphere had veiled the horizon round,<br/>
When Satan, who late fled before the threats<br/>
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved<br/>
In meditated fraud and malice, bent<br/>
On Man's destruction, maugre what might hap<br/>
Of heavier on himself, fearless returned.<br/>
By night he fled, and at midnight returned<br/>
From compassing the Earth-cautious of day<br/>
Since Uriel, Regent of the Sun, descried<br/>
His entrance, and forwarned the Cherubim<br/>
That kept their watch. Thence, full of anguish, driven,<br/>
The space of seven continued nights he rode<br/>
With darkness-thrice the equinoctial line<br/>
He circled, four times crossed the car of Night<br/>
From pole to pole, traversing each colure—<br/>
On the eighth returned, and on the coast averse<br/>
From entrance or cherubic watch by stealth<br/>
Found unsuspected way. There was a place<br/>
(Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change)<br/>
Where Tigris, at the foot of Paradise,<br/>
Into a gulf shot under ground, till part<br/>
Rose up a fountain by the Tree of Life.<br/>
In with the river sunk, and with it rose,<br/>
Satan, involved in rising mist; then sought<br/>
Where to lie hid. Sea he had searched and land<br/>
From Eden over Pontus, and the Pool<br/>
Maeotis, up beyond the river Ob;<br/>
Downward as far Antartic; and, in length,<br/>
West from Orontes to the ocean barred<br/>
At Darien, thence to the land where flows<br/>
Ganges and Indus. Thus the orb he roamed<br/>
With narrow search, and with inspection deep<br/>
Considered every creature, which of all<br/>
Most opportune might serve his wiles, and found<br/>
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field.<br/>
Him, after long debate, irresolute<br/>
Of thoughts revolved, his final sentence chose<br/>
Fit vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom<br/>
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide<br/>
From sharpest sight; for in the wily snake<br/>
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark<br/>
As from his wit and native subtlety<br/>
Proceeding, which, in other beasts observed,<br/>
Doubt might beget of diabolic power<br/>
Active within beyond the sense of brute.<br/>
Thus he resolved, but first from inward grief<br/>
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured:—

"O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred<br/>
More justly, seat worthier of Gods, as built<br/>
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!<br/>
For what God, after better, worse would build?<br/>
Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens,<br/>
That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,<br/>
Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,<br/>
In thee concentring all their precious beams<br/>
Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven<br/>
Is centre, yet extends to all, so thou<br/>
Centring receiv'st from all those orbs; in thee,<br/>
Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears,<br/>
Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth<br/>
Of creatures animate with gradual life<br/>
Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man.<br/>
With what delight could I have walked thee round,<br/>
If I could joy in aught-sweet interchange<br/>
Of hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,<br/>
Now land, now sea, and shores with forest crowned,<br/>
Rocks, dens, and caves! But I in none of these<br/>
Find place or refuge; and the more I see<br/>
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel<br/>
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege<br/>
Of contraries; all good to me becomes<br/>
Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state.<br/>
But neither here seek I, nor in Heaven,<br/>
To dwell, unless by maistring Heaven's Supreme;<br/>
Nor hope to be myself less miserable<br/>
By what I seek, but others to make such<br/>
As I, though thereby worse to me redound.<br/>
For only in destroying I find ease<br/>
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyed,<br/>
Or won to what may work his utter loss,<br/>
For whom all this was made, all this will soon<br/>
Follow, as to him linked in weal or woe:<br/>
In woe then, that destruction wide may range!<br/>
To me shall be the glory sole among<br/>
The Infernal Powers, in one day to have marred<br/>
What he, Almighty styled, six nights and days<br/>
Continued making, and who knows how long<br/>
Before had been contriving? though perhaps<br/>
Not longer than since I in one night freed<br/>
From servitude inglorious well nigh half<br/>
The Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng<br/>
Of his adorers. He, to be avenged,<br/>
And to repair his numbers thus impaired—<br/>
Whether such virtue, spent of old, now failed<br/>
More Angels to create (if they at least<br/>
Are his created), or to spite us more—<br/>
Determined to advance into our room<br/>
A creature formed of earth, and him endow,<br/>
Exalted from so base original,<br/>
With heavenly spoils, our spoils. What he decreed<br/>
He effected; Man he made, and for him built<br/>
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,<br/>
Him Lord pronounced, and, O indignity!<br/>
Subjected to his service Angel-wings<br/>
And flaming ministers, to watch and tend<br/>
Their earthly charge. Of these the vigilance<br/>
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist<br/>
Of midnight vapour, glide obscure, and pry<br/>
In every bush and brake, where hap may find<br/>
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazy folds<br/>
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.<br/>
O foul descent! that I, who erst contended<br/>
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constrained<br/>
Into a beast, and, mixed with bestial slime,<br/>
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,<br/>
That to the highth of Deity aspired!<br/>
But what will not ambition and revenge<br/>
Descend to? Who aspires must down as low<br/>
As high he soared, obnoxious, first or last,<br/>
To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,<br/>
Bitter ere long back on itself recoils.<br/>
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,<br/>
Since higher I fall short, on him who next<br/>
Provokes my envy, this new favourite<br/>
Of Heaven, this Man of Clay, son of despite,<br/>
Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raised<br/>
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid."

So saying, through each thicket, dank or dry,<br/>
Like a black mist low-creeping, he held on<br/>
His midnight search, where soonest he might find<br/>
The Serpent. Him fast sleeping soon he found,<br/>
In labyrinth of many a round self-rowled,<br/>
His head the midst, well stored with subtle wiles:<br/>
Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den:<br/>
Nor nocent yet, but on the grassy herb,<br/>
Fearless, unfeared, he slept. In at his mouth<br/>
The Devil entered, and his brutal sense.<br/>
In heart or head, possessing soon inspired<br/>
With act intelligential; but his sleep<br/>
Disturbed not, waiting close the approach of morn.

Now, whenas sacred light began to dawn<br/>
In Eden on the humid flowers, that breathed<br/>
Their morning incense, when all things that breathe<br/>
From the Earth's great altar send up silent praise<br/>
To the Creator, and his nostrils fill<br/>
With grateful smell, forth came the human pair,<br/>
And joined their vocal worship to the quire<br/>
Of creatures wanting voice; that done, partake<br/>
The season, prime for sweetest scents and airs;<br/>
Then commune how that day they best may ply<br/>
Their growing work-for much their work outgrew<br/>
The hands' dispatch of two gardening so wide:<br/>
And Eve first to her husband thus began:—

"Adam, well may we labour still to dress<br/>
This Garden, still to tend plant, herb, and flower,<br/>
Our pleasant task enjoined; but, till more hands<br/>
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,<br/>
Luxurious by restraint: what we by day<br/>
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,<br/>
One night or two with wanton growth derides,<br/>
Tending to wild. Thou, therefore, now advise,<br/>
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present.<br/>
Let us divide our labours-thou where choice<br/>
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind<br/>
The woodbine round this arbour, or direct<br/>
The clasping ivy where to climb; while I<br/>
In yonder spring of roses intermixed<br/>
With myrtle find what to redress till noon.<br/>
For, while so near each other thus all day<br/>
Our task we choose, what wonder if so near<br/>
Looks intervene and smiles, or objects new<br/>
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits<br/>
Our day's work, brought to little, though begun<br/>
Early, and the hour of supper comes unearned!"

To whom mild answer Adam thus returned:—<br/>
"Sole Eve, associate sole, to me beyond<br/>
Compare above all living creatures dear!<br/>
Well hast thou motioned, well thy thoughts imployed<br/>
How we might best fulfil the work which here<br/>
God hath assigned us, nor of me shalt pass<br/>
Unpraised; for nothing lovelier can be found<br/>
In woman than to study household good,<br/>
And good works in her husband to promote.<br/>
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed<br/>
Labour as to debar us when we need<br/>
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,<br/>
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse<br/>
Of looks and smiles; for smiles from reason flow<br/>
To brute denied, and are of love the food—<br/>
Love, not the lowest end of human life.<br/>
For not to irksome toil, but to delight,<br/>
He made us, and delight to reason joined.<br/>
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands<br/>
Will keep from wilderness with ease, as wide<br/>
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long<br/>
Assist us. But, if much converse perhaps<br/>
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield;<br/>
For solitude sometimes is best society,<br/>
And short retirement urges sweet return.<br/>
But other doubt possesses me, lest harm<br/>
Befall thee, severed from me; for thou know'st<br/>
What hath been warned us-what malicious foe,<br/>
Envying our happiness, and of his own<br/>
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame<br/>
By sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand<br/>
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find<br/>
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,<br/>
Hopeless to circumvent us joined, where each<br/>
To other speedy aid might lend at need.<br/>
Whether his first design be to withdraw<br/>
Our fealty from God, or to disturb<br/>
Conjugal love-than which perhaps no bliss<br/>
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more—<br/>
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side<br/>
That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects.<br/>
The wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,<br/>
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays,<br/>
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures."

To whom the virgin majesty of Eve,<br/>
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,<br/>
With sweet austere composure thus replied:—

"Offspring of Heaven and Earth, and all Earth's lord!<br/>
That such an Enemy we have, who seeks<br/>
Our ruin, both by thee informed I learn,<br/>
And from the parting Angel overheard,<br/>
As in a shady nook I stood behind,<br/>
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers.<br/>
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt<br/>
To God or thee, because we have a foe<br/>
May tempt it, I expected not to hear.<br/>
His violence thou fear'st not, being such<br/>
As we, not capable of death or pain,<br/>
Can either not receive, or can repel.<br/>
His fraud is, then, thy fear; which plain infers<br/>
Thy equal fear that my firm faith and love<br/>
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced:<br/>
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy breast,<br/>
Adam! misthought of her to thee so dear?"

To whom, with healing words, Adam replied:—<br/>
"Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve!—<br/>
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire—<br/>
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade<br/>
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid<br/>
The attempt itself, intended by our Foe.<br/>
For he who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses<br/>
The tempted with dishonour foul, supposed<br/>
Not incorruptible of faith, not proof<br/>
Against temptation. Thou thyself with scorn<br/>
And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong,<br/>
Though ineffectual found; misdeem not, then,<br/>
If such affront I labour to avert<br/>
From thee alone, which on us both at once<br/>
The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare;<br/>
Or, daring, first on me the assault shall light.<br/>
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn—<br/>
Subtle he needs must be who could seduce<br/>
Angels-nor think superfluous others' aid.<br/>
I from the influence of thy looks receive<br/>
Access in every virtue-in thy sight<br/>
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were<br/>
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,<br/>
Shame to be overcome or overreached,<br/>
Would utmost vigour raise, and raised unite.<br/>
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel<br/>
When I am present, and thy trial choose<br/>
With me, best witness of thy virtue tried?"

So spake domestic Adam in his care<br/>
And matrimonial love; but Eve, who thought<br/>
Less attributed to her faith sincere,<br/>
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed:—

"If this be our condition, thus to dwell<br/>
In narrow circuit straitened by a Foe,<br/>
Subtle or violent, we not endued<br/>
Single with like defence wherever met,<br/>
How are we happy, still in fear of harm?<br/>
But harm precedes not sin: only our Foe<br/>
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem<br/>
Of our integrity: his foul esteem<br/>
Sticks no dishonour on our front, but turns<br/>
Foul on himself; then wherefore shunned or feared<br/>
By us, who rather double honour gain<br/>
From his surmise proved false, find peace within,<br/>
Favour from Heaven, our witness, from the event?<br/>
And what is faith, love, virtue, unassayed<br/>
Alone, without exterior help sustained?<br/>
Let us not then suspect our happy state<br/>
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise<br/>
As not secure to single or combined.<br/>
Frail is our happiness, if this be so;<br/>
And Eden were no Eden, thus exposed."

To whom thus Adam fervently replied:—<br/>
"O Woman, best are all things as the will<br/>
Of God ordained them; his creating hand<br/>
Nothing imperfet or deficient left<br/>
Of all that he created-much less Man,<br/>
Or aught that might his happy state secure,<br/>
Secure from outward force. Within himself<br/>
The danger lies, yet lies within his power;<br/>
Against his will he can receive no harm.<br/>
But God left free the Will; for what obeys<br/>
Reason is free; and Reason he made right,<br/>
But bid her well beware, and still erect,<br/>
Lest, by some fair appearing good surprised,<br/>
She dictate false, and misinform the Will<br/>
To do what God expressly hath forbid.<br/>
Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins<br/>
That I should mind thee oft; and mind thou me,<br/>
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,<br/>
Since Reason not impossibly may meet<br/>
Some specious object by the foe suborned,<br/>
And fall into deception unaware,<br/>
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.<br/>
Seek not temptation, then, which to avoid<br/>
Were better, and most likely if from me<br/>
Thou sever not: trial will come unsought.<br/>
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve<br/>
First thy obedience; the other who can know,<br/>
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?<br/>
But, if thou think trial unsought may find<br/>
Us both securer than thus warned thou seem'st,<br/>
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more.<br/>
Go in thy native innocence; rely<br/>
On what thou hast of virtue; summon all;<br/>
For God towards thee hath done his part: do thine."

So spake the Patriarch of Mankind; but Eve<br/>
Persisted; yet submiss, though last, replied:—

"With thy permission, then, and thus forewarned,<br/>
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words<br/>
Touched only, that our trial, when least sought,<br/>
May find us both perhaps far less prepared,<br/>
The willinger I go, nor much expect<br/>
A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;<br/>
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse."

Thus saying, from her husband's hand her hand<br/>
Soft she withdrew, and, like a wood-nymph light,<br/>
Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's train,<br/>
Betook her to the groves, but Delia's self<br/>
In gait surpassed and goddess-like deport,<br/>
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,<br/>
But with such gardening tools as Art, yet rude,<br/>
Guiltless of fire had formed, or Angels brought.<br/>
To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,<br/>
Likest she seemed-Pomona when she fled<br/>
Vertumnus-or to Ceres in her prime,<br/>
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.<br/>
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued<br/>
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.<br/>
Oft he to her his charge of quick return<br/>
Repeated; she to him as oft engaged<br/>
To be returned by noon amid the bower,<br/>
And all things in best order to invite<br/>
Noontide repast, or afternoon's repose.<br/>
O much deceived, much failing, hapless Eve,<br/>
Of thy presumed return! event perverse!<br/>
Thou never from that hour in Paradise<br/>
Found'st either sweet repast or sound repose;<br/>
Such ambush, hid among sweet flowers and shades,<br/>
Waited, with hellish rancour imminent,<br/>
To intercept thy way, or send thee back<br/>
Despoiled of innocence, of faith, of bliss.<br/>
For now, and since first break of dawn, the Fiend,<br/>
Mere Serpent in appearance, forth was come,<br/>
And on his quest where likeliest he might find<br/>
The only two of mankind, but in them<br/>
The whole included race, his purposed prey.<br/>
In bower and field he sought, where any tuft<br/>
Of grove or garden-plot more pleasant lay,<br/>
Their tendance or plantation for delight;<br/>
By fountain or by shady rivulet<br/>
He sought them both, but wished his hap might find<br/>
Eve separate; he wished, but not with hope<br/>
Of what so seldom chanced, when to his wish,<br/>
Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,<br/>
Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,<br/>
Half-spied, so thick the roses bushing round<br/>
About her glowed, oft stooping to support<br/>
Each flower of tender stalk, whose head, though gay<br/>
Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,<br/>
Hung drooping unsustained. Them she upstays<br/>
Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while<br/>
Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,<br/>
From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.<br/>
Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed<br/>
Of stateliest covert, cedar, pine, or palm;<br/>
Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen<br/>
Among thick-woven arborets, and flowers<br/>
Imbordered on each bank, the hand of Eve:<br/>
Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned<br/>
Or of revived Adonis, or renowned<br/>
Alcinous, host of old Laertes' son,<br/>
Or that, not mystic, where the sapient king<br/>
Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse.<br/>
Much he the place admired, the person more.<br/>
As one who, long in populous city pent,<br/>
Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air,<br/>
Forth issuing on a summer's morn, to breathe<br/>
Among the pleasant villages and farms<br/>
Adjoined, from each thing met conceives delight—<br/>
The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,<br/>
Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound—<br/>
If chance with nymph-like step fair virgin pass,<br/>
What pleasing seemed for her now pleases more,<br/>
She most, and in her look sums all delight:<br/>
Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold<br/>
This flowery plat, the sweet recess of Eve<br/>
Thus early, thus alone. Her heavenly form<br/>
Angelic, but more soft and feminine,<br/>
Her graceful innocence, her every air<br/>
Of gesture or least action, overawed<br/>
His malice, and with rapine sweet bereaved<br/>
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought.<br/>
That space the Evil One abstracted stood<br/>
From his own evil, and for the time remained<br/>
Stupidly good, of enmity disarmed,<br/>
Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge.<br/>
But the hot hell that always in him burns,<br/>
Though in mid Heaven, soon ended his delight,<br/>
And tortures him now more, the more he sees<br/>
Of pleasure not for him ordained. Then soon<br/>
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts<br/>
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites:—

"Thoughts, whither have ye led me? with what sweet<br/>
Compulsion thus transported to forget<br/>
What hither brought us? hate, not love, nor hope<br/>
Of Paradise for Hell, here to taste<br/>
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,<br/>
Save what is in destroying; other joy<br/>
To me is lost. Then let me not let pass<br/>
Occasion which now smiles. Behold alone<br/>
The Woman, opportune to all attempts—<br/>
Her husband, for I view far round, not nigh,<br/>
Whose higher intellectual more I shun,<br/>
And strength, of courage haughty, and of limb<br/>
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould;<br/>
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound—<br/>
I not; so much hath Hell debased, and pain<br/>
Infeebled me, to what I was in Heaven.<br/>
She fair, divinely fair, fit love for Gods,<br/>
Not terrible, though terror be in love,<br/>
And beauty, not approached by stronger hate,<br/>
Hate stronger under show of love well feigned—<br/>
The way which to her ruin now I tend."

So spake the Enemy of Mankind, enclosed<br/>
In serpent, inmate bad, and toward Eve<br/>
Addressed his way-not with indented wave,<br/>
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his rear,<br/>
Circular base of rising folds, that towered<br/>
Fold above fold, a surging maze; his head<br/>
Crested aloft, and carbuncle his eyes;<br/>
With burnished neck of verdant gold, erect<br/>
Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass<br/>
Floated redundant. Pleasing was his shape<br/>
And lovely; never since the serpent kind<br/>
Lovelier-not those that in Illyria changed<br/>
Hermione and Cadmus, or the God<br/>
In Epidaurus; nor to which transformed<br/>
Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline, was seen,<br/>
He with Olympias, this with her who bore<br/>
Scipio, the highth of Rome. With tract oblique<br/>
At first, as one who sought access but feared<br/>
To interrupt, sidelong he works his way.<br/>
As when a ship, by skilful steersman wrought<br/>
Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind<br/>
Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail,<br/>
So varied he, and of his tortuous train<br/>
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve,<br/>
To lure her eye. She, busied, heard the sound<br/>
Of rustling leaves, but minded not, as used<br/>
To such disport before her through the field<br/>
From every beast, more duteous at her call<br/>
Than at Circean call the herd disguised.<br/>
He, bolder now, uncalled before her stood,<br/>
But as in gaze admiring. Oft he bowed<br/>
His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck,<br/>
Fawning, and licked the ground whereon she trod.<br/>
His gentle dumb expression turned at length<br/>
The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad<br/>
Of her attention gained, with serpent-tongue<br/>
Organic, or impulse of vocal air,<br/>
His fraudulent temptation thus began:—

"Wonder not, sovran mistress (if perhaps<br/>
Thou canst who art sole wonder), much less arm<br/>
Thy looks, the heaven of mildness, with disdain,<br/>
Displeased that I approach thee thus, and gaze<br/>
Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feared<br/>
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.<br/>
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair,<br/>
Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine<br/>
By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore,<br/>
With ravishment beheld-there best beheld<br/>
Where universally admired. But here,<br/>
In this enclosure wild, these beasts among,<br/>
Beholders rude, and shallow to discern<br/>
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,<br/>
Who sees thee (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen<br/>
A Goddess among Gods, adored and served<br/>
By Angels numberless, thy daily train?"

So glozed the Tempter, and his proem tuned.<br/>
Into the heart of Eve his words made way,<br/>
Though at the voice much marvelling; at length,<br/>
Not unamazed, she thus in answer spake:—

"What may this mean? Language of Man pronounced<br/>
By tongue of brute, and human sense expressed!<br/>
The first at least of these I thought denied<br/>
To beasts, whom God on their creation-day<br/>
Created mute to all articulate sound;<br/>
The latter I demur, for in their looks<br/>
Much reason, and in their actions, oft appears.<br/>
Thee, Serpent, subtlest beast of all the field<br/>
I knew, but not with human voice endued;<br/>
Redouble, then, this miracle, and say,<br/>
How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how<br/>
To me so friendly grown above the rest<br/>
Of brutal kind that daily are in sight:<br/>
Say, for such wonder claims attention due."

To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied:—<br/>
"Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve!<br/>
Easy to me it is to tell thee all<br/>
What thou command'st, and right thou shouldst be obeyed.<br/>
I was at first as other beasts that graze<br/>
The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low,<br/>
As was my food, nor aught but food discerned<br/>
Or sex, and apprehended nothing high:<br/>
Till on a day, roving the field, I chanced<br/>
A goodly tree far distant to behold,<br/>
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed,<br/>
Ruddy and gold. In nearer drew to gaze;<br/>
When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,<br/>
Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense<br/>
Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats<br/>
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,<br/>
Unsucked of lamb or kid, that tend their play.<br/>
To satisfy the sharp desire I had<br/>
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolved<br/>
Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once,<br/>
Powerful persuaders, quickened at the scent<br/>
Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen.<br/>
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon;<br/>
For, high from ground, the branches would require<br/>
Thy utmost reach, or Adam's; round the Tree<br/>
All other beasts that saw, with like desire<br/>
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.<br/>
Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung<br/>
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill<br/>
I spared not; for such pleasure till that hour<br/>
At feed or fountain never had I found.<br/>
Sated at length, ere long I might perceive<br/>
Strange alteration in me, to degree<br/>
Of Reason in my inward powers, and Speech<br/>
Wanted not long, though to this shape retained.<br/>
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep<br/>
I turned my thoughts, and with capacious mind<br/>
Considered all things visible in Heaven,<br/>
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good.<br/>
But all that fair and good in thy Divine<br/>
Semblance, and in thy beauty's heavenly ray,<br/>
United I beheld-no fair to thine<br/>
Equivalent or second; which compelled<br/>
Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come<br/>
And gaze, and worship thee of right declared<br/>
Sovran of creatures, universal Dame!"

So talked the spirited sly Snake; and Eve,<br/>
Yet more amazed, unwary thus replied:—

"Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt<br/>
The virtue of that Fruit, in thee first proved.<br/>
But say, where grows the Tree? from hence how far?<br/>
For many are the trees of God that grow<br/>
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown<br/>
To us; in such abundance lies our choice<br/>
As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched,<br/>
Still hanging incorruptible, till men<br/>
Grow up to their provision, and more hands<br/>
Help to disburden Nature of her bearth."

To whom the wily Adder, blithe and glad;—<br/>
"Empress, the way is ready, and not long—<br/>
Beyond a row of myrtles, on a flat,<br/>
Fast by a fountain, one small thicket past<br/>
Of blowing myrrh and balm. If thou accept<br/>
My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon."

"Lead, then," said Eve. He, leading, swiftly rowled<br/>
In tangles, and made intricate seem straight,<br/>
To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy<br/>
Brightens his crest. As when a wandering fire,<br/>
Compact of unctuous vapour, which the night<br/>
Condenses, and the cold invirons round,<br/>
Kindled through agitation to a flame<br/>
(Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends),<br/>
Hovering and blazing with delusive light,<br/>
Misleads the amazed night-wanderer from his way<br/>
To bogs and mires, and oft through pond or pool,<br/>
There swallowed up and lost, from succour far:<br/>
So glistered the dire Snake, and into fraud<br/>
Led Eve, our credulous mother, to the Tree<br/>
Of Prohibition, root of all our woe;<br/>
Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake:—

"Serpent, we might have spared our coming hither,<br/>
Fruitless to me, though fruit be here to excess,<br/>
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee—<br/>
Wondrous, indeed, if cause of such effects!<br/>
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch;<br/>
God so commanded, and left that command<br/>
Sole daughter of his voice: the rest, we live<br/>
Law to ourselves; our Reason is our Law."

To whom the Tempter guilefully replied:—<br/>
"Indeed! Hath God then said that of the fruit<br/>
Of all these garden-trees ye shall not eat,<br/>
Yet lords declared of all in Earth or Air?"

To whom thus Eve, yet sinless:—"Of the fruit<br/>
Of each tree in the garden we may eat;<br/>
But of the fruit of this fair Tree, amidst<br/>
The Garden, God hath said, 'Ye shall not eat<br/>
Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.'"

She scarce had said, though brief, when now more bold<br/>
The Tempter, but, with shew of zeal and love<br/>
To Man, and indignation at his wrong,<br/>
New part puts on, and, as to passion moved,<br/>
Fluctuates disturbed, yet comely, and in act<br/>
Raised, as of some great matter to begin.<br/>
As when of old some orator renowned<br/>
In Athens or free Rome, where eloquence<br/>
Flourished, since mute, to some great cause addressed,<br/>
Stood in himself collected, while each part,<br/>
Motion, each act, won audience ere the tongue<br/>
Sometimes in highth began, as no delay<br/>
Of preface brooking through his zeal of right:<br/>
So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown,<br/>
The Tempter, all impassioned, thus began:—<br/>
"O sacred, wise, and wisdom-giving Plant,<br/>
Mother of science! now I feel thy power<br/>
Within me clear, not only to discern<br/>
Things in their causes, but to trace the ways<br/>
Of highest agents, deemed however wise.<br/>
Queen of this Universe! do not believe<br/>
Those rigid threats of death. Ye shall not die.<br/>
How should ye? By the Fruit? it gives you life<br/>
To knowledge. By the Threatener? look on me,<br/>
Me who have touched and tasted, yet both live,<br/>
And life more perfect have attained than Fate<br/>
Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot.<br/>
Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast<br/>
Is open? or will God incense his ire<br/>
For such a petty trespass, and not praise<br/>
Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain<br/>
Of death denounced, whatever thing Death be,<br/>
Deterred not from achieving what might lead<br/>
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil?<br/>
Of good, how just! of evil-if what is evil<br/>
Be real, why not known, since easier shunned?<br/>
God, therefore, cannot hurt ye and be just;<br/>
Not just, not God; not feared then, nor obeyed:<br/>
Your fear itself of death removes the fear.<br/>
Why, then, was this forbid? Why but to awe,<br/>
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,<br/>
His worshipers? He knows that in the day<br/>
Ye eat thereof your eyes, that seem so clear,<br/>
Yet are but dim, shall perfectly be then<br/>
Opened and cleared, and ye shall be as Gods,<br/>
Knowing both good and evil, as they know.<br/>
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,<br/>
Internal Man, is but proportion meet—<br/>
I, of brute, human; ye, of human, Gods.<br/>
So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off<br/>
Human, to put on Gods-death to be wished,<br/>
Though threatened, which no worse than this can bring!<br/>
And what are Gods, that Man may not become<br/>
As they, participating godlike food?<br/>
The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br/>
On our belief, that all from them proceeds.<br/>
I question it; for this fair Earth I see,<br/>
Warmed by the Sun, producing every kind;<br/>
Them nothing. If they all things, who enclosed<br/>
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,<br/>
That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains<br/>
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies<br/>
The offence, that Man should thus attain to know?<br/>
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree<br/>
Impart against his will, if all be his?<br/>
Or is it envy? and can envy dwell<br/>
In Heavenly breasts? These, these and many more<br/>
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.<br/>
Goddess humane, reach, then, and freely taste!"

He ended; and his words, replete with guile,<br/>
Into her heart too easy entrance won.<br/>
Fixed on the Fruit she gazed, which to behold<br/>
Might tempt alone; and in her ears the sound<br/>
Yet rung of his persuasive words, impregned<br/>
With reason, to her seeming, and with truth.<br/>
Meanwhile the hour of noon drew on, and waked<br/>
An eager appetite, raised by the smell<br/>
So savoury of that Fruit, which with desire,<br/>
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,<br/>
Solicited her longing eye; yet first,<br/>
Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused:—

"Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of Fruits,<br/>
Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admired,<br/>
Whose taste, too long forborne, at first assay<br/>
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br/>
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise.<br/>
Thy praise he also who forbids thy use<br/>
Conceals not from us, naming thee the Tree<br/>
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of Good and Evil;<br/>
Forbids us then to taste. But his forbidding<br/>
Commends thee more, while it infers the good<br/>
By thee communicated, and our want;<br/>
For good unknown sure is not bad, or, had<br/>
And yet unknown, is as not had at all.<br/>
In plain, then, what forbids he but to know?<br/>
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise!<br/>
Such prohibitions bind not. But, if Death<br/>
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then<br/>
Our inward freedom? In the day we eat<br/>
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is we shall die!<br/>
How dies the Serpent? He hath eaten, and lives,<br/>
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns,<br/>
Irrational till then. For us alone<br/>
Was death invented? or to us denied<br/>
This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?<br/>
For beasts it seems; yet that one beast which first<br/>
Hath tasted envies not, but brings with joy<br/>
The good befallen him, author unsuspect,<br/>
Friendly to Man, far from deceit or guile.<br/>
What fear I, then? rather, what know to fear<br/>
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,<br/>
Of God or Death, of law or penalty?<br/>
Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine,<br/>
Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,<br/>
Of virtue to make wise. What hinders, then,<br/>
To reach, and feed at once both body and mind?"

So saying, her rash hand in evil hour<br/>
Forth-reaching to the Fruit, she plucked, she eat.<br/>
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat,<br/>
Sighing through all her works, gave signs of woe<br/>
That all was lost. Back to the thicket slunk<br/>
The guilty Serpent, and well might, for Eve,<br/>
Intent now only her taste, naught else<br/>
Regarded; such delight till then, as seemed,<br/>
In fruit she never tasted, whether true,<br/>
Or fancied so through expectation high<br/>
Of knowledge; nor was Godhead from her thought.<br/>
Greedily she ingorged without restraint,<br/>
And knew not eating death. Satiate at length,<br/>
And hightened as with wine, jocond and boon,<br/>
Thus to herself she pleasingly began:—

"O sovran, virtuous, precious of all trees<br/>
In Paradise! of operation blest<br/>
To sapience, hitherto obscured, infamed,<br/>
And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end<br/>
Created! but henceforth my early care,<br/>
Not without song, each morning, and due praise,<br/>
Shall tend thee, and tde fertil burden ease<br/>
Of thy full branches, offered free to all;<br/>
Till, dieted by thee, I grow mature<br/>
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know,<br/>
Though others envy what they cannot give—<br/>
For, had the gift been theirs, it had not here<br/>
Thus grown! Experience, next to thee I owe,<br/>
Best guide: not following thee, I had remained<br/>
In ignorance; thou open'st Wisdom's way,<br/>
And giv'st access, though secret she retire.<br/>
And I perhaps am secret: Heaven is high—<br/>
High, and remote to see from thence distinct<br/>
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps<br/>
May have diverted from continual watch<br/>
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies<br/>
About him. But to Adam in what sort<br/>
Shall I appear? Shall I to him make known<br/>
As yet my change, and give him to partake<br/>
Full happiness with me, or rather not,<br/>
But keep the odds of knowledge in my power<br/>
Without copartner? so to add what wants<br/>
In female sex, the more to draw his love,<br/>
And render me more equal, and perhaps—<br/>
A thing not undesirable-sometime<br/>
Superior; for, inferior, who is free?<br/>
This may be well; but what if God have seen,<br/>
And death ensue? Then I shall be no more;<br/>
And Adam, wedded to another Eve,<br/>
Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct!<br/>
A death to think! Confirmed, then, I resolve<br/>
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe.<br/>
So dear I love him that with him all deaths<br/>
I could endure, without him live no life."

So saying, from the Tree her step she turned,<br/>
But first low reverence done, as to the Power<br/>
That dwelt within, whose presence had infused<br/>
Into the plant sciential sap, derived<br/>
From nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while,<br/>
Waiting desirous her return, had wove<br/>
Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn<br/>
Her tresses, and her rural labours crown,<br/>
As reapers oft are wont their harvest-queen.<br/>
Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new<br/>
Solace in her return, so long delayed;<br/>
Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,<br/>
Misgave him. He the faltering measure felt,<br/>
And forth to meet her went, the way she took<br/>
That morn when first they parted. By the Tree<br/>
Of Knowledge he must pass; there he her met,<br/>
Scarce from the Tree returning; in her hand<br/>
A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,<br/>
New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.<br/>
To him she hasted; in her face excuse<br/>
Came prologue, and apology to prompt,<br/>
Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed:—

"Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?<br/>
Thee I have missed, and thought it long, deprived<br/>
Thy presence-agony of love till now<br/>
Not felt, nor shall be twice; for never more<br/>
Mean I to try, what rash untried I sought,<br/>
The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange<br/>
Hath been the cause, and wonderful to hear.<br/>
This Tree is not, as we are told, a Tree<br/>
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown<br/>
Opening the way, but of divine effect<br/>
To open eyes, and make them Gods who taste;<br/>
And hath been tasted such. The Serpent wise,<br/>
Or not restrained as we, or not obeying,<br/>
Hath eaten of the Fruit, and is become<br/>
Not dead, as we are threatened, but thenceforth<br/>
Endued with human voice and human sense,<br/>
Reasoning to admiration, and with me<br/>
Persuasively hath so prevailed that I<br/>
Have also tasted, and have also found<br/>
The effects to correspond-opener mine eyes,<br/>
Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart,<br/>
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br/>
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.<br/>
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss;<br/>
Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon.<br/>
Thou, therefore, also taste, that equal lot<br/>
May join us, equal joy, as equal love;<br/>
Lest, thou not tasting, different degree<br/>
Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce<br/>
Deity for thee, when fate will not permit."

Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told;<br/>
But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed.<br/>
On the other side, Adam, soon as he heard<br/>
The fatal trespass done by Eve, amazed,<br/>
Astonied stood and blank, while horror chill<br/>
Ran through his veins, and all his joints relaxed.<br/>
From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve<br/>
Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed.<br/>
Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length<br/>
First to himself he inward silence broke:—

"O fairest of Creation, last and best<br/>
Of all God's works, creature in whom excelled<br/>
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed,<br/>
Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!<br/>
How art thou lost! how on a sudden lost,<br/>
Defaced, deflowered, and now to death devote!<br/>
Rather, how hast thou yielded to transgress<br/>
The strict forbiddance, how to violate<br/>
The sacred Fruit forbidden? Some cursed fraud<br/>
Of enemy hath beguiled thee, yet unknown,<br/>
And me with thee hath ruined; for with thee<br/>
Certain my resolution is to die.<br/>
How can I live without thee? how forgo<br/>
Thy sweet converse, and love so dearly joined,<br/>
To live again in these wild woods forlorn?<br/>
Should God create another Eve, and I<br/>
Another rib afford, yet loss of thee<br/>
Would never from my heart. No, no! I feel<br/>
The link of nature draw me: flesh of flesh,<br/>
Bone of my bone thou art, and from thy state<br/>
Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe."

So having said, as one from sad dismay<br/>
Recomforted, and, after thoughts disturbed,<br/>
Submitting to what seemed remediless,<br/>
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned:—

"Bold deed thou hast presumed, adventrous Eve,<br/>
And peril great provoked, who thus hast dared<br/>
Had it been only coveting to eye<br/>
That sacred Food, sacred to abstinence;<br/>
Much more to taste it, under ban to touch.<br/>
But past who can recall, or done undo?<br/>
Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate! Yet so<br/>
Perhaps thou shalt not die; perhaps the fact<br/>
Is not so hainous now-foretasted Fruit,<br/>
Profaned first by the Serpent, by him first<br/>
Made common and unhallowed ere our taste,<br/>
Nor yet on him found deadly. He yet lives—<br/>
Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,<br/>
Higher degree of life: inducement strong<br/>
To us, as likely, tasting, to attain<br/>
Proportional ascent; which cannot be<br/>
But to be Gods, or Angels, Demi-gods.<br/>
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,<br/>
Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy<br/>
Us, his prime creatures, dignified so high,<br/>
Set over all his works; which, in our fall,<br/>
For us created, needs with us must fail,<br/>
Dependent made. So God shall uncreate,<br/>
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose—<br/>
Not well conceived of God; who, though his power<br/>
Creation could repeat, yet would be loth<br/>
Us to abolish, lest the Adversary<br/>
Triumph and say: 'Fickle their state whom God<br/>
Most favours; who can please him long? Me first<br/>
He ruined, now Mankind; whom will he next?'—<br/>
Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe.<br/>
However, I with thee have fixed my lot,<br/>
Certain to undergo like doom. If death<br/>
Consort with thee, death is to me as life;<br/>
So forcible within my heart I feel<br/>
The bond of Nature draw me to my own—<br/>
My own is thee; for what thou art is mine.<br/>
Our state cannot be severed; we are one,<br/>
One flesh; to lose thee were to lose myself."

So Adam; and thus Eve to him replied:—<br/>
"O glorious trial of exceeding love,<br/>
Illustrious evidence, example high!<br/>
Ingaging me to emulate; but, short<br/>
Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,<br/>
Adam? from whose dear side I boast me sprung,<br/>
And gladly of our union hear thee speak,<br/>
One heart, one soul in both; whereof good proof<br/>
This day affords, declaring thee resolved,<br/>
Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,<br/>
Shall separate us, linked in love so dear,<br/>
To undergo with me one guilt, one crime,<br/>
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit;<br/>
Whose virtue (for of good still good proceeds,<br/>
Direct, or by occasion) hath presented<br/>
This happy trial of thy love, which else<br/>
So eminently never had been known.<br/>
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue<br/>
This my attempt, I would sustain alone<br/>
The worst, and not persuade thee-rather die<br/>
Deserted than oblige thee with a fact<br/>
Pernicious to thy peace, chiefly assured<br/>
Remarkably so late of thy so true,<br/>
So faithful love unequalled. But I feel<br/>
Far otherwise the event-not death, but life<br/>
Augmented, opened eyes, new hopes, new joys,<br/>
Taste so divine that what of sweet before<br/>
Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh.<br/>
On my experience, Adam, freely taste,<br/>
And fear of death deliver to the winds."

So saying, she embraced him, and for joy<br/>
Tenderly wept, much won that he his love<br/>
Had so ennobled as of choice to incur<br/>
Divine displeasure for her sake, or death.<br/>
In recompense (for such compliance bad<br/>
Such recompense best merits), from the bough<br/>
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit<br/>
With liberal hand. He scrupled not to eat,<br/>
Against his better knowledge, not deceived,<br/>
But fondly overcome with female charm.<br/>
Earth trembled from her entrails, as again<br/>
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan;<br/>
Sky loured, and, muttering thunder, some sad drops<br/>
Wept at completing of the mortal Sin<br/>
Original; while Adam took no thought,<br/>
Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate<br/>
Her former trespass feared, the more to soothe<br/>
Him with her loved society; that now,<br/>
As with new wine intoxicated both,<br/>
They swim in mirth, and fancy that they feel<br/>
Divinity within them breeding wings<br/>
Wherewith to scorn the Earth. But that false Fruit<br/>
Far other operation first displayed,<br/>
Carnal desire inflaming. He on Eve<br/>
Began to cast lascivious eyes; she him<br/>
As wantonly repaid; in lust they burn,<br/>
Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move:—

"Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste<br/>
And elegant-of sapience no small part;<br/>
Since to each meaning savour we apply,<br/>
And palate call judicious. I the praise<br/>
Yield thee; so well this day thou hast purveyed.<br/>
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstained<br/>
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now<br/>
True relish, tasting. If such pleasure be<br/>
In things to us forbidden, it might be wished<br/>
For this one Tree had been forbidden ten.<br/>
But come; so well refreshed, now let us play,<br/>
As meet is, after such delicious fare;<br/>
For never did thy beauty, since the day<br/>
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorned<br/>
With all perfections, so enflame my sense<br/>
With ardour to enjoy thee, fairer now<br/>
Than ever-bounty of this virtuous Tree!"

So said he, and forbore not glance or toy<br/>
Of amorous intent, well understood<br/>
Of Eve, whose eye darted contagious fire.<br/>
Her hand he seized, and to a shady bank,<br/>
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered,<br/>
He led her, nothing loth; flowers were the couch,<br/>
Pansies, and violets, and asphodel,<br/>
And hyacinth-Earth's freshest, softest lap.<br/>
There they their fill of love and love's disport<br/>
Took largely, of their mutual gilt the seal,<br/>
The solace of their sin, till dewy sleep<br/>
Oppressed them, wearied with their amorous play.

Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,<br/>
That with exhilarating vapour bland<br/>
About their spirits han played, and inmost powers<br/>
Made err, was now exhaled, and grosser sleep,<br/>
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams<br/>
Incumbered, now had left them, up they rose<br/>
As from unrest, and, each the other viewing,<br/>
Soon found their eyes how opened, and their minds<br/>
How darkened. Innocence, that as a veil<br/>
Had shadowed them from knowing ill, was gone;<br/>
Just confidence, and native righteousness,<br/>
And honour, from about them, naked left<br/>
To guilty Shame: he covered, but his robe<br/>
Uncovered more. So rose the Danite strong,<br/>
Herculean Samson, from the harlot-lap<br/>
Of Philistean Dalilah, and waked<br/>
Shorn of his strength; they destitute and bare<br/>
Of all their virtue. Silent, and in face<br/>
Confounded, long they sat, as strucken mute;<br/>
Till Adam, though not less than Eve abashed,<br/>
At length gave utterance to these words constrained:—

"O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give ear<br/>
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught<br/>
To counterfeit Man's voice-true in our fall,<br/>
False in our promised rising; since our eyes<br/>
Opened we find indeed, and find we know<br/>
Both good and evil, good lost and evil got:<br/>
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,<br/>
Which leaves us naked thus, of honour void,<br/>
Of innocence, of faith, of purity,<br/>
Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained,<br/>
And in our faces evident the signs<br/>
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store,<br/>
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first<br/>
Be sure then. How shall I behold the face<br/>
Henceforth of God or Angel, erst with joy<br/>
And rapture so oft beheld? Those Heavenly Shapes<br/>
Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze<br/>
Insufferably bright. Oh, might I here<br/>
In solitude live savage, in some glade<br/>
Obscured, where highest woods, impenetrable<br/>
To star or sunlight, spread their umbrage broad,<br/>
And brown as evening. Cover me, ye pines!<br/>
Ye cedars, with innumerable boughs<br/>
Hide me, where I may never see them more!<br/>
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise<br/>
What best may, for the present, serve to hide<br/>
The parts of each other that seem most<br/>
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen—<br/>
Some tree, whose broad smooth leaves, together sewed,<br/>
And girded on our loins, may cover round<br/>
Those middle parts, that this new comer, Shame,<br/>
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean."

So counselled he, and both together went<br/>
Into the thickest wood. There soon they choose<br/>
The fig tree-not that kind for fruit renowned,<br/>
But such, as at this day, to Indians known,<br/>
In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms<br/>
Braunching so broad and long that in the ground<br/>
The bended twigs take root, and daughters grow<br/>
About the mother tree, a pillared shade<br/>
High overarched, and echoing walks between:<br/>
There oft the Indian herdsman, shunning heat,<br/>
Shelters in cool, and tends his pasturing herds<br/>
At loop-holes cut through thickest shade. Those leaves<br/>
They gathered, broad as Amazonian targe,<br/>
And with what skill they had together sewed,<br/>
To gird their waist-vain covering, if to hide<br/>
Their guilt and dreaded shame! O how unlike<br/>
To that first naked glory! Such of late<br/>
Columbus found the American, so girt<br/>
With feathered cincture, naked else and wild,<br/>
Among the trees on isles and woody shores.<br/>
Thus fenced, and, as they thought, their shame in part<br/>
Covered, but not at rest or ease of mind,<br/>
They sat them down to weep. Nor only tears<br/>
Rained at their eyes, but high winds worse within<br/>
Began to rise, high passions-anger, hate,<br/>
Mistrust, suspicion, discord-and shook sore<br/>
Their inward state of mind, calm region once<br/>
And full of peace, now tost and turbulent:<br/>
For Understanding ruled not, and the Will<br/>
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now<br/>
To sensual Appetite, who, from beneath<br/>
Usurping over sovran Reason, claimed<br/>
Superior sway. From thus distempered breast<br/>
Adam, estranged in look and altered style,<br/>
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed:—

"Would thou hadst hearkened to my words, and stayed<br/>
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange<br/>
Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,<br/>
I know not whence possessed thee! We had then<br/>
Remained still happy-not, as now, despoiled<br/>
Of all our good, shamed, naked, miserable!<br/>
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve<br/>
The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek<br/>
Such proof, conclude they then begin to fail."

To whom, soon moved with touch of blame, thus Eve:—<br/>
"What words have passed thy lips, Adam severe?<br/>
Imput'st thou that to my default, or will<br/>
Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows<br/>
But might as ill have happened thou being by,<br/>
Or to thyself perhaps? Hadst thou been there,<br/>
Or here the attempt, thou couldst not have discerned<br/>
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;<br/>
No ground of enmity between us known<br/>
Why he should mean me ill or seek to harm;<br/>
Was I to have never parted from thy side?<br/>
As good have grown there still, a lifeless rib.<br/>
Being as I am, why didst not thou, the Head,<br/>
Command me absolutely not to go,<br/>
Going into such danger, as thou saidst?<br/>
Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay,<br/>
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.<br/>
Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent,<br/>
Neither had I transgressed, nor thou with me."

To whom, then first incensed, Adam replied:—<br/>
"Is this the love, is this the recompense<br/>
Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, expressed<br/>
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I—<br/>
Who might have lived, and joyed immortal bliss,<br/>
Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?<br/>
And am I now upbraided as the cause<br/>
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,<br/>
It seems, in thy restraint! What could I more?<br/>
I warned thee, I admonished thee, foretold<br/>
The danger, and the lurking Enemy<br/>
That lay in wait; beyond this had been force,<br/>
And force upon free will hath here no place.<br/>
But confidence then bore thee on, secure<br/>
Either to meet no danger, or to find<br/>
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps<br/>
I also erred in overmuch admiring<br/>
What seemed in thee so perfet that I thought<br/>
No evil durst attempt thee, But I rue<br/>
That error now, which is become my crime,<br/>
And thou the accuser. Thus it shall befall<br/>
Him who, to worth in women overtrusting,<br/>
Lets her will rule: restraint she will not brook;<br/>
And, left to herself, if evil thence ensue,<br/>
She first his weak indulgence will accuse."

Thus they in mutual accusation spent<br/>
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning;<br/>
And of their vain contest' appeared no end.

<h2>Book 10</h2>

Meanwhile the hainous and despiteful act<br/>
Of Satan done in Paradise, and how<br/>
He, in the Serpent, had perverted Eve,<br/>
Her Husband she, to taste the fatal Fruit,<br/>
Was known in Heaven; for what can scape the eye<br/>
Of God all-seeing, or deceive his heart<br/>
Omniscient? who, in all things wise and just,<br/>
Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind<br/>
Of Man, with strength entire and free will armed<br/>
Complete to have discovered and repulsed<br/>
Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend.<br/>
For still they knew, and ought to have still remembered,<br/>
The high injunction not to taste that Fruit,<br/>
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying<br/>
Incurred (what could they less?) the penalty,<br/>
And, manifold in sin, deserved to fall.<br/>
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste<br/>
The Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad<br/>
For Man; for of his state by this they knew,<br/>
Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen<br/>
Entrance unseen. Soon as the unwelcome news<br/>
From Earth arrived at Heaven-gate, displeased<br/>
All were who heard; dim sadness did not spare<br/>
That time celestial visages, yet, mixed<br/>
With pity, violated not their bliss.<br/>
About the new-arrived in multitudes,<br/>
The Ethereal People ran, to hear and know<br/>
How all befell. They towards the Throne supreme,<br/>
Accountable, made haste, to make appear,<br/>
With righteous plea, their utmost vigilance,<br/>
And easily approved; when the Most High,<br/>
Eternal Father, from his secret Cloud<br/>
Amidst, in thunder uttered thus his voice:—

"Assembled Angels, and ye Powers returned<br/>
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismayed<br/>
Nor troubled at these tidings from the Earth,<br/>
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,<br/>
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,<br/>
When first this Tempter crossed the gulf from Hell.<br/>
I told ye then he should prevail, and speed<br/>
On his bad errand-Man should be seduced,<br/>
And flattered out of all, believing lies<br/>
Against his Maker; no decree of mine,<br/>
Concurring to necessitate his fall,<br/>
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse<br/>
His free will, to her own inclining left<br/>
In even scale. But fallen he is; and now<br/>
What rests, but that the mortal sentence pass<br/>
On his transgression, Death denounced that day<br/>
Which he presumes already vain and void,<br/>
Because not yet inflicted, as he feared,<br/>
By some immediate stroke, but soon shall find<br/>
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.<br/>
Justice shall not return, as bounty, scorned.<br/>
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee,<br/>
Vicegerent Son? To thee I have transferred<br/>
All judgment, whether in Heaven, or Earth, or Hell.<br/>
Easy it may be seen that I intend<br/>
Mercy colleague with justice, sending thee,<br/>
Man's Friend, his Mediator, his designed<br/>
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntary,<br/>
And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen."

So spake the Father; and, unfolding bright<br/>
Toward the right hand his glory, on the Son<br/>
Blazed forth unclouded deity. He full<br/>
Resplendent all his Father manifest<br/>
Expressed, and thus divinely answered mild:—

"Father Eternal, thine is to decree;<br/>
Mine both in Heaven and Earth to do thy will<br/>
Supreme, that thou in me, thy Son beloved,<br/>
May'st ever rest well pleased. I go to judge<br/>
On Earth these thy transgressors; but thou know'st,<br/>
Whoever judged, the worst on me must light,<br/>
When time shall be; for so I undertook<br/>
Before thee, and, not repenting, this obtain<br/>
Of right, that I may mitigate their doom<br/>
On me derived. Yet I shall temper so<br/>
Justice with mercy as may illustrate most<br/>
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.<br/>
Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none<br/>
Are to behold the judgment but the judged,<br/>
Those two; the third best absent is condemned,<br/>
Convict by flight, and rebel to all law;<br/>
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs."

Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose<br/>
Of high collateral glory. Him Thrones and Powers,<br/>
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant,<br/>
Accompanied to Heaven-gate, from whence<br/>
Eden and all the coast in prospect lay.<br/>
Down he descended straight; the speed of Gods<br/>
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes winged.

Now was the Sun in western cadence low<br/>
From noon, and gentle airs due at their hour<br/>
To fan the Earth now waked, and usher in<br/>
The evening cool, when he, from wrauth more cool,<br/>
Came, the mild Judge and Intercessor both,<br/>
To sentence Man. The voice of God they heard<br/>
Now walking in the Garden, by soft winds<br/>
Brought to their ears, while day declined; they heard,<br/>
And from his presence hid themselves among<br/>
The thickest trees, both man and wife, till God,<br/>
Approaching, thus to Adam called aloud:—

"Where art thou, Adam, wont with joy to meet<br/>
My coming, seen far off? I miss thee here,<br/>
Not pleased thus entertained, with solitude,<br/>
Where obvious duty erewhile appeared unsought.<br/>
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change<br/>
Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth!"

He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first<br/>
To offend, discountenanced both, and discomposed.<br/>
Love was not in their looks, either to God<br/>
Or to each other, but apparent guilt,<br/>
And shame, and perturbation, and despair,<br/>
Anger, and obstinacy, and hate, and guile.<br/>
Whence Adam, faltering long, thus answered brief:—

"I heard thee in the Garden, and, of thy voice<br/>
Afraid, being naked, hid myself." To whom<br/>
The gracious Judge, without revile, replied:—

"My voice thou oft has heard, and hast not feared,<br/>
But still rejoiced; how is it now become<br/>
So dreadful to thee? That thou art naked who<br/>
Hath told thee? Hast thou eaten of the Tree<br/>
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?"<br/>
To whom thus Adam, sore beset, replied:—

"O Heaven! in evil strait this day I stand<br/>
Before my Judge-either to undergo<br/>
Myself the total crime, or to accuse<br/>
My other self, the partner of my life,<br/>
Whose failing, while her faith to me remains,<br/>
I should conceal, and not expose to blame<br/>
By my complaint. But strict necessity<br/>
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,<br/>
Lest on my head both sin and punishment,<br/>
However insupportable, be all<br/>
Devolved; though, should I hold my peace, yet thou<br/>
Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.<br/>
This Woman, whom thou mad'st to be my help,<br/>
And gav'st me as thy perfect gift, so good,<br/>
So fit, so acceptable, so divine,<br/>
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,<br/>
And what she did, whatever in itself,<br/>
Her doing seemed to justify the deed—<br/>
She gave me of the Tree, and I did eat."<br/>
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied:—

"Was she thy God, that her thou didst obey<br/>
Before his voice? or was she made thy guide,<br/>
Superior, or but equal, that to her<br/>
Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place<br/>
Wherein God set thee above her, made of thee<br/>
And for thee, whose perfection far excelled<br/>
Hers in all real dignity? Adorned<br/>
She was indeed, and lovely, to attract<br/>
Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts<br/>
Were such as under government well seemed—<br/>
Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part<br/>
And person, hadst thou known thyself aright."

So having said, he thus to Eve in few:—<br/>
"Say, Woman, what is this which thou hast done?"

To whom sad Eve, with shame nigh overwhelmed,<br/>
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge<br/>
Bold or loquacious, thus abashed replied:—<br/>
"The Serpent me beguiled, and I did eat."

Which when the Lord God heard, without delay<br/>
To judgment he proceeded on the accused<br/>
Serpent, though brute, unable to transfer<br/>
The guilt on him who made him instrument<br/>
Of mischief, and polluted from the end<br/>
Of his creation-justly then accursed,<br/>
As vitiated in nature. More to know<br/>
Concerned not Man (since he no further knew),<br/>
Nor altered his offence; yet God at last<br/>
To Satan, first in sin, his doom applied,<br/>
Though in mysterious terms, judged as then best;<br/>
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall:—

"Because thou hast done this, thou art accursed<br/>
Above all cattle, each beast of the field;<br/>
Upon thy belly grovelling thou shalt go,<br/>
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life.<br/>
Between thee and the Woman I will put<br/>
Enmity, and between thine and her seed;<br/>
Her seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel."

So spake this oracle-then verified<br/>
When Jesus, son of Mary, second Eve,<br/>
Saw Satan fall like lightning down from Heaven,<br/>
Prince of the Air; then, rising from his grave,<br/>
Spoiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed<br/>
In open shew, and, with ascension bright,<br/>
Captivity led captive through the Air,<br/>
The realm itself of Satan, long usurped,<br/>
Whom He shall tread at last under our feet,<br/>
Even He who now foretold his fatal bruise,<br/>
And to the Woman thus his sentence turned:—

"Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply<br/>
By thy conception; children thou shalt bring<br/>
In sorrow forth, and to thy husband's will<br/>
Thine shall submit; he over thee shall rule."

On Adam last thus judgment he pronounced:—<br/>
"Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife,<br/>
And eaten of the Tree concerning which<br/>
I charged thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat thereof,<br/>
Curs'd is the ground for thy sake; thou in sorrow<br/>
Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life;<br/>
Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth<br/>
Unbid; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;<br/>
In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat bread,<br/>
Till thou return unto the ground; for thou<br/>
Out of the ground wast taken: know thy birth,<br/>
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust return."

So judged he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,<br/>
And the instant stroke of death, denounced that day,<br/>
Removed far off; then, pitying how they stood<br/>
Before him naked to the air, that now<br/>
Must suffer change, disdained not to begin<br/>
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume.<br/>
As when he washed his servants' feet, so now,<br/>
As Father of his family, he clad<br/>
Their nakedness with skins of beasts, or slain,<br/>
Or, as the snake, with youthful coat repaid;<br/>
And thought not much to clothe his enemies.<br/>
Nor he their outward only with the skins<br/>
Of beasts, but inward nakedness, much more<br/>
Opprobrious, with his robe of righteousness<br/>
Arraying, covered from his Father's sight.<br/>
To him with swift ascent he up returned,<br/>
Into his blissful bosom reassumed<br/>
In glory as of old; to him, appeased,<br/>
All, though all-knowing, what had passed with Man<br/>
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.

Meanwhile, ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth,<br/>
Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death,<br/>
In counterview within the gates, that now<br/>
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame<br/>
Far into Chaos, since the Fiend passed through,<br/>
Sin opening; who thus now to Death began:—

"O Son, why sit we here, each other viewing<br/>
Idly, while Satan, our great author, thrives<br/>
In other worlds, and happier sent provides<br/>
For us, his offspring dear? It cannot be<br/>
But that success attends him; if mishap<br/>
Ere this he had returned, with fury driven<br/>
By his Avengers, since no place like this<br/>
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.<br/>
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,<br/>
Wings growing, and dominion given me large<br/>
Beyond this Deep-whatever draws me on,<br/>
Or sympathy, or some connatural force,<br/>
Powerful at greatest distance to unite<br/>
With secret amity things of like kind<br/>
By secretest conveyance. Thou, my shade<br/>
Inseparable, must with me along;<br/>
For Death from Sin no power can separate.<br/>
But, lest the difficulty of passing back<br/>
Stay his return perhaps over this gulf<br/>
Impassable, impervious, let us try<br/>
(Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine<br/>
Not unagreeable!) to found a path<br/>
Over this Main from Hell to that new World<br/>
Where Satan now prevails-a monument<br/>
Of merit high to all the infernal Host,<br/>
Easing their passage hence, for intercourse<br/>
Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead.<br/>
Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn<br/>
By this new-felt attraction and instinct."

Whom thus the meagre Shadow answered soon:—<br/>
"Go whither fate and inclination strong<br/>
Leads thee; I shall not lag behind, nor err<br/>
The way, thou leading: such a scent I draw<br/>
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br/>
The savour of death from all things there that live.<br/>
Nor shall I do the work thou enterprisest<br/>
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid."

So saying, with delight he snuffed the smell<br/>
Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock<br/>
Of ravenous fowl, though many a league remote,<br/>
Against the day of battle, to a field<br/>
Where armies lie encamped come flying, lured<br/>
With scent of living carcases designed<br/>
For death the following day in bloody fight;<br/>
So scented the grim Feature, and upturned<br/>
His nostril wide into the murky air,<br/>
Sagacious of his quarry from so far.<br/>
Then both, from out Hell-gates, into the waste<br/>
Wide anarchy of Chaos, damp and dark,<br/>
Flew diverse, and, with power (their power was great)<br/>
Hovering upon the waters, what they met<br/>
Solid or slimy, as in raging sea<br/>
Tossed up and down, together crowded drove,<br/>
From each side shoaling, towards the mouth of Hell;<br/>
As when two polar winds, blowing adverse<br/>
Upon the Cronian sea, together drive<br/>
Mountains of ice, that stop the imagined way<br/>
Beyond Petsora eastward to the rich<br/>
Cathaian coast. The aggregated soil<br/>
Death with his mace petrific, cold and dry,<br/>
As with a trident smote, and fixed as firm<br/>
As Delos, floating once; the rest his look<br/>
Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move,<br/>
And with asphaltic slime; broad as the gate,<br/>
Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach<br/>
They fastened, and the mole immense wraught on<br/>
Over the foaming Deep high-arched, a bridge<br/>
Of length prodigious, joining to the wall<br/>
Immovable of this now fenceless World,<br/>
Forfeit to Death-from hence a passage broad,<br/>
Smooth, easy, inoffensive, down to Hell.<br/>
So, if great things to small may be compared,<br/>
Xerxes, the liberty lf Greece to yoke,<br/>
From Susa, his Memnonian palace high,<br/>
Came to the sea, and, over Hellespont<br/>
Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joined,<br/>
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves.<br/>
Now had they brought the work by wondrous art<br/>
Pontifical-a ridge of pendent rock<br/>
Over the vexed Abyss, following the track<br/>
Of Satan, to the self-same place where he<br/>
First lighted from his wing and landed safe<br/>
From out of Chaos-to the outside bare<br/>
Of this round World. With pins of adamant<br/>
And chains they made all fast, too fast they made<br/>
And durable; and now in little space<br/>
The confines met of empyrean Heaven<br/>
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell,<br/>
With long reach interposed; three several ways<br/>
In sight of each of these three places led.<br/>
And now their way to Earth they had described,<br/>
To Paradise first tending, when, behold<br/>
Satan, in likeness of an Angel bright,<br/>
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering<br/>
His zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose!<br/>
Disguised he came; but those his children dear<br/>
Their parent soon discerned, though in disguise.<br/>
He, after Eve seduced, unminded slunk<br/>
Into the wood fast by, and, changing shape<br/>
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act<br/>
By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded<br/>
Upon her husband-saw their shame that sought<br/>
Vain covertures; but, when he saw descend<br/>
The Son of God to judge them, terrified<br/>
He fled, not hoping to escape, but shun<br/>
The present-fearing, guilty, what his wrauth<br/>
Might suddenly inflict; that past, returned<br/>
By night, and, listening where the hapless pair<br/>
Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint,<br/>
Thence gathered his own doom; which understood<br/>
Not instant, but of future time, with joy<br/>
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned,<br/>
And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot<br/>
Of this new wondrous pontifice, unhoped<br/>
Met who to meet him came, his offspring dear.<br/>
Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight<br/>
Of that stupendious bridge his joy increased.<br/>
Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair<br/>
Inchanting daughter, thus the silence broke:—

"O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,<br/>
Thy trophies! which thou view'st as not thine own;<br/>
Thou art their Author and prime Architect.<br/>
For I no sooner in my heart divined<br/>
(My heart, which by a secret harmony<br/>
Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet)<br/>
That thou on Earth hadst prospered, which thy looks<br/>
Now also evidence, but straight I felt—<br/>
Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt—<br/>
That I must after thee with this thy son;<br/>
Such fatal consequence unites us three.<br/>
Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,<br/>
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure<br/>
Detain from following thy illustrious track.<br/>
Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined

Within Hell-gates till now; thou us impowered<br/>
To fortify thus far, and overlay<br/>
With this portentous bridge the dark Abyss.<br/>
Thine now is all this World; thy virtue hath won<br/>
What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gained,<br/>
With odds, what war hath lost, and fully avenged<br/>
Our foil in Heaven. Here thou shalt Monarch reign,<br/>
There didst not; there let him still victor sway,<br/>
As battle hath adjudged, from this new World<br/>
Retiring, by his own doom alienated,<br/>
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide<br/>
Of all things, parted by the empyreal bounds,<br/>
His quadrature, from thy orbicular World,<br/>
Or try thee now more dangerous to his Throne."

Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answered glad:—<br/>
"Fair daughter, and thou, son and grandchild both,<br/>
High proof ye now have given to be the race<br/>
Of Satan (for I glory in the name,<br/>
Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King),<br/>
Amply have merited of me, of all<br/>
The Infernal Empire, that so near Heaven's door<br/>
Triumphal with triumphal act have met,<br/>
Mine with this glorious work, and made one realm<br/>
Hell and this World-one realm, one continent<br/>
Of easy thoroughfare. Therefore, while I<br/>
Descend through Darkness, on your road with ease,<br/>
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint<br/>
With these successes, and with them rejoice<br/>
You two this way, among these numerous orbs,<br/>
All yours, right down to Paradise descend;<br/>
There dwell and reign in bliss; thence on the Earth<br/>
Dominion exercise and in the air,<br/>
Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared;<br/>
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.<br/>
My substitutes I send ye, and create<br/>
Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might<br/>
Issuing from me. On your joint vigour now<br/>
My hold of this new kingdom all depends,<br/>
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.<br/>
If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell<br/>
No detriment need fear; go, and be strong."

So saying, he dismissed them; they with speed<br/>
Their course through thickest constellations held,<br/>
Spreading their bane; the blasted stars looked wan,<br/>
And planets, planet-strook, real eclipse<br/>
Then suffered. The other way Satan went down<br/>
The causey to Hell-gate; on either side<br/>
Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,<br/>
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,<br/>
That scorned his indignation. Through the gate,<br/>
Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,<br/>
And all about found desolate; for those<br/>
Appointed to sit there had left their charge,<br/>
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all<br/>
Far to the inland retired, about the walls<br/>
Of Pandemonium, city and proud seat<br/>
Of Lucifer, so by allusion called<br/>
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned.<br/>
There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand<br/>
In council sat, solicitous what chance<br/>
Might intercept their Emperor sent; so he<br/>
Departing gave command, and they observed.<br/>
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,<br/>
By Astracan, over the snowy plains,<br/>
Retires, or Bactrian Sophi, from the horns<br/>
Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond<br/>
The realm of Aladule, in his retreat<br/>
To Tauris or Casbeen; so these, the late<br/>
Heaven-banished host, left desert utmost Hell<br/>
Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch<br/>
Round their Metropolis, and now expecting<br/>
Each hour their great Adventurer from the search<br/>
Of foreign worlds. He through the midst unmarked,<br/>
In shew plebeian Angel militant<br/>
Of lowest order, passed, and, from the door<br/>
Of that Plutonian hall, invisible<br/>
Ascended his high Throne, which, under state<br/>
Of richest texture spread, at the upper end<br/>
Was placed in regal lustre. Down a while<br/>
He sat, and round about him saw, unseen.<br/>
At last, as from a cloud, his fulgent head<br/>
And shape star-bright appeared, or brighter, clad<br/>
With what permissive glory since his fall<br/>
Was left him, or false glitter. All amazed<br/>
At that so sudden blaze, the Stygian throng<br/>
Bent their aspect, and whom they wished beheld,<br/>
Their mighty Chief returned: loud was the acclaim.<br/>
Forth rushed in haste the great consulting Peers,<br/>
Raised from their dark Divan, and with like joy<br/>
Congratulant approached him, who with hand<br/>
Silence, and with these words attention, won:—

"Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers!—<br/>
For in possession such, not only of right,<br/>
I call ye, and declare ye now, returned,<br/>
Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth<br/>
Triumphant out of this infernal Pit<br/>
Abominable, accursed, the house of woe,<br/>
And dungeon of our tyrant! Now possess,<br/>
As lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven<br/>
Little inferior, by my adventure hard<br/>
With peril great achieved. Long were to tell<br/>
What I have done, what suffered, with what pain<br/>
Voyaged the unreal, vast, unbounded Deep<br/>
Of horrible confusion-over which<br/>
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved,<br/>
To expedite your glorious march; but I<br/>
Toiled out my uncouth passage, forced to ride<br/>
The untractable Abyss, plunged in the womb<br/>
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild,<br/>
That, jealous of their secrets, fiercely opposed<br/>
My journey strange, with clamorous uproar<br/>
Protesting Fate supreme; thence how I found<br/>
The new-created World, which fame in Heaven<br/>
Long had foretold, a fabric wonderful,<br/>
Of absolute perfection; therein Man<br/>
Placed in a Paradise, by our exile<br/>
Made happy. Him by fraud I have seduced<br/>
From his Creator, and, the more to increase<br/>
Your wonder, with an apple! He, thereat<br/>
Offended-worth your laughter!-hath given up<br/>
Both his beloved Man and all his World<br/>
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,<br/>
Without our hazard, labour, or alarm,<br/>
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man<br/>
To rule, as over all he should have ruled.<br/>
True is, me also he hath judged; or rather<br/>
Me not, but the brute Serpent, in whose shape<br/>
Man I deceived. That which to me belongs<br/>
Is enmity, which he will put between<br/>
Me and Mankind: I am to bruise his heel;<br/>
His seed-when is not set-shall bruise my head!<br/>
A world who would not purchase with a bruise,<br/>
Or much more grievous pain? Ye have the account<br/>
Of my performance; what remains, ye Gods,<br/>
But up and enter now into full bliss?"

So having said, a while he stood, expecting<br/>
Their universal shout and high applause<br/>
To fill his ear; when, contrary, he hears,<br/>
On all sides, from innumerable tongues<br/>
A dismal universal hiss, the sound<br/>
Of public scorn. He wondered, but not long<br/>
Had leisure, wondering at himself now more.<br/>
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,<br/>
His arms clung to his ribs, his legs entwining<br/>
Each other, till, supplanted, down he fell,<br/>
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,<br/>
Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power<br/>
Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,<br/>
According to his doom. He would have spoke,<br/>
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue<br/>
To forked tongue; for now were all transformed<br/>
Alike, to serpents all, as accessories<br/>
To his bold riot. Dreadful was the din<br/>
Of hissing through the hall, thick-swarming now<br/>
With complicated monsters, head and tail—<br/>
Scorpion, and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire,<br/>
Cerastes horned, Hydrus, and Ellops drear,<br/>
And Dipsas (not so thick swarmed once the soil<br/>
Bedropt with blood of Gordon, or the isle<br/>
Ophiusa); but still greatest the midst,<br/>
Now Dragon grown, larger than whom the Sun<br/>
Ingendered in the Phythian vale on slime,<br/>
Huge Python; and his power no less he seemed<br/>
Above the rest still to retain. They all<br/>
Him followed, issuing forth to the open field,<br/>
Where all yet left of that revolted rout,<br/>
Heaven-fallen, in station stood or just array,<br/>
Sublime with expectation when to see<br/>
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief.<br/>
They saw, but other sight instead-a crowd<br/>
Of ugly serpents! Horror on them fell,<br/>
And horrid sympathy; for what they saw<br/>
They felt themselves now changing. Down their arms,<br/>
Down fell both spear and shield; down they as fast,<br/>
And the dire hiss renewed, and the dire form<br/>
Catched by contagion, like in punishment<br/>
As in their crime. Thus was the applause they meant<br/>
Turned to exploding hiss, triumph to shame<br/>
Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood<br/>
A grove hard by, sprung up with this their change,<br/>
His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br/>
Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that<br/>
Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve<br/>
Used by the Tempter. On that prospect strange<br/>
Their earnest eyes they fixed, imagining<br/>
For one forbidden tree a multitude<br/>
Now risen, to work them further woe or shame;<br/>
Yet, parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce<br/>
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,<br/>
But on they rowled in heaps, and, up the trees<br/>
Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks<br/>
That curled Megaera. Greedily they plucked<br/>
The fruitage fair to sight, like that which grew<br/>
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed;<br/>
This, more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br/>
Deceived; they fondly thinking to allay<br/>
Their appetite with gust, instead of fruit<br/>
Chewed bitter ashes, which the offended taste<br/>
With spattering noise rejected. Off they assayed,<br/>
Hunger and thirst constraining; drugged as oft,<br/>
With hatefulest disrelish writhed their jaws<br/>
With soot and cinder filled; so oft they fell<br/>
Into the same illusion, not as Man<br/>
Whom they triumphed' once lapsed. Thus were they plagued,<br/>
And, worn with famine, long and ceaseless hiss,<br/>
Till their lost shape, permitted, they resumed—<br/>
Yearly enjoined, some say, to undergo<br/>
This annual humbling certain numbered days,<br/>
To dash their pride, and joy for Man seduced.<br/>
However, some tradition they dispersed<br/>
Among the Heathen of their purchase got,<br/>
And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called<br/>
Ophion, with Eurynome (the wide—<br/>
Encroaching Eve perhaps), had first the rule<br/>
Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driven<br/>
And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.

Meanwhile in Paradise the Hellish pair<br/>
Too soon arrived-Sin, there in power before<br/>
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell<br/>
Habitual habitant; behind her Death,<br/>
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet<br/>
On his pale horse; to whom Sin thus began:—

"Second of Satan sprung, all-conquering Death!<br/>
What think'st thou of our empire now? though earned<br/>
With travail difficult, not better far<br/>
Than still at Hell's dark threshold to have sat watch,<br/>
Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half-starved?"

Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answered soon:—<br/>
"To me, who with eternal famine pine,<br/>
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven—<br/>
There best where most with ravin I may meet:<br/>
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems<br/>
To stuff this maw, this vast unhide-bound corpse."

To whom the incestuous Mother thus replied:—<br/>
"Thou, therefore, on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,<br/>
Feed first; on each beast next, and fish, and fowl—<br/>
No homely morsels; and whatever thing<br/>
The scythe of Time mows down devour unspared;<br/>
Till I, in Man residing through the race,<br/>
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect,<br/>
And season him thy last and sweetest prey."

This said, they both betook them several ways,<br/>
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make<br/>
All kinds, and for destruction to mature<br/>
Sooner or later; which the Almighty seeing,<br/>
From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,<br/>
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice:—

"See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance<br/>
To waste and havoc yonder World, which I<br/>
So fair and good created, and had still<br/>
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man<br/>
Let in these wasteful furies, who impute<br/>
Folly to me (so doth the Prince of Hell<br/>
And his adherents), that with so much ease<br/>
I suffer them to enter and possess<br/>
A place so heavenly, and, conniving, seem<br/>
To gratify my scornful enemies,<br/>
That laugh, as if, transported with some fit<br/>
Of passion, I to them had quitted all,<br/>
At random yielded up to their misrule;<br/>
And know not that I called and drew them thither,<br/>
My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draft and filth<br/>
Which Man's polluting sin with taint hath shed<br/>
On what was pure; till, crammed and gorged, nigh burst<br/>
With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling<br/>
Of thy victorious arm, well-pleasing Son,<br/>
Both Sin and Death, and yawning Grave, at last<br/>
Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell<br/>
For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.<br/>
Then Heaven and Earth, renewed, shall be made pure<br/>
To sanctity that shall receive no stain:<br/>
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes."

He ended, and the Heavenly Audience loud<br/>
Sung Halleluiah, as the sound of seas,<br/>
Through multitude that sung:—"Just are thy ways,<br/>
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works;<br/>
Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,<br/>
Destined restorer of Mankind, by whom<br/>
New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise,<br/>
Or down from Heaven descend." Such was their song,<br/>
While the Creator, calling forth by name<br/>
His mighty Angels, gave them several charge,<br/>
As sorted best with present things. The Sun<br/>
Had first his precept so to move, so shine,<br/>
As might affect the Earth with cold and heat<br/>
Scarce tolerable, and from the north to call<br/>
Decrepit winter, from the south to bring<br/>
Solstitial summer's heat. To the blanc Moon<br/>
Her office they prescribed; to the other five<br/>
Their planetary motions and aspects,<br/>
In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,<br/>
Of noxious efficacy, and when to join<br/>
In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed<br/>
Their influence malignant when to shower—<br/>
Which of them, rising with the Sun or falling,<br/>
Should prove tempestuous. To the winds they set<br/>
Their corners, when with bluster to confound<br/>
Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll<br/>
With terror through the dark aerial hall.<br/>
Some say he bid his Angels turn askance<br/>
The poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more<br/>
From the Sun's axle; they with labour pushed<br/>
Oblique the centric Globe: some say the Sun<br/>
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road<br/>
Like distant breadth-to Taurus with the seven<br/>
Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,<br/>
Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amain<br/>
By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,<br/>
As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change<br/>
Of seasons to each clime. Else had the spring<br/>
Perpetual smiles on Earth with vernant flowers,<br/>
Equal in days and nights, except to those<br/>
Beyond the polar circles; to them day<br/>
Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun,<br/>
To recompense his distance, in their sight<br/>
Had rounded still the horizon, and not known<br/>
Or east or west-which had forbid the snow<br/>
From cold Estotiland, and south as far<br/>
Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit,<br/>
The Sun, as from Thyestean banquet, turned<br/>
His course intended; else how had the world<br/>
Inhabited, though sinless, more than now<br/>
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?<br/>
These changes in the heavens, though slow, produced<br/>
Like change on sea and land-sidereal blast,<br/>
Vapour, and mist, and exhalation hot,<br/>
Corrupt and pestilent. Now from the north<br/>
Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shore,<br/>
Bursting their brazen dungeon, armed with ice,<br/>
And snow, and hail, and stormy gust and flaw,<br/>
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud<br/>
And Thrascias rend the woods, and seas upturn;<br/>
With adverse blasts upturns them from the south<br/>
Notus and Afer, black with thundrous clouds<br/>
From Serraliona; thwart of these, as fierce<br/>
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds,<br/>
Eurus and Zephyr, with their lateral noise,<br/>
Sirocco and Libecchio. Thus began<br/>
Outrage from lifeless things; but Discord first,<br/>
Daughter of Sin, among the irrational<br/>
Death introduced through fierce antipathy.<br/>
Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,<br/>
And fish with fish. To graze the herb all leaving<br/>
Devoured each other; nor stood much in awe<br/>
Of Man, but fled him, or with countenance grim<br/>
Glared on him passing. These were from without<br/>
The growing miseries; which Adam saw<br/>
Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,<br/>
To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within,<br/>
And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,<br/>
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint:—

"O miserable of happy! Is this the end<br/>
Of this new glorious World, and me so late<br/>
The glory of that glory? who now, become<br/>
Accursed of blessed, hide me from the face<br/>
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth<br/>
Of happiness! Yet well, if here would end<br/>
The misery! I deserved it, and would bear<br/>
My own deservings. But this will not serve:<br/>
All that I eat or drink, or shall beget,<br/>
Is propagated curse. O voice, once heard<br/>
Delightfully, 'Encrease and multiply,'<br/>
Now death to hear! for what can I encrease<br/>
Or multiply but curses on my head?<br/>
Who, of all ages to succeed, but, feeling<br/>
The evil on him brought by me, will curse<br/>
My head? 'Ill fare our Ancestor impure!<br/>
For this we may thank Adam!' but his thanks<br/>
Shall be the execration. So, besides<br/>
Mine own that bide upon me, all from me<br/>
Shall with a fierce reflux on me redound—<br/>
On me, as on their natural centre, light;<br/>
Heavy, though in their place. O fleeting joys<br/>
Of Paradise, dear bought with lasting woes!<br/>
Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay<br/>
To mould me Man? Did I solicit thee<br/>
From darkness to promote me, or here place<br/>
In this delicious Garden? As my will<br/>
Concurred not to my being, it were but right<br/>
And equal to reduce me to my dust,<br/>
Desirous to resign and render back<br/>
All I received, unable to perform<br/>
Thy term too hard, by which I was to hold<br/>
The good I sought not. To the loss of that,<br/>
Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added<br/>
The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable<br/>
Thy justice seems. Yet, to say truth, too late<br/>
I thus contest; then should have been refused<br/>
Those terms, whatever, when they were proposed.<br/>
Thou didst accept them: wilt thou enjoy the good,<br/>
Then cavil the conditions? And, though God<br/>
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son<br/>
Prove disobedient, and, reproved, retort,<br/>
'Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not!'<br/>
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee<br/>
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,<br/>
But natural necessity, begot.<br/>
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own<br/>
To serve him; thy reward was of his grace;<br/>
Thy punishment, then, justly is at his will.<br/>
Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair,<br/>
That dust I am, and shall to dust return.<br/>
O welcome hour whenever! Why delays<br/>
His hand to execute what his decree<br/>
Fixed on this day? Why do I overlive?<br/>
Why am I mocked with death, and lengthened out<br/>
To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet<br/>
Mortality, my sentence, and be earth<br/>
Insensible! how glad would lay me down<br/>
As in my mother's lap! There I should rest,<br/>
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more<br/>
Would thunder in my ears; no fear of worse<br/>
To me and to my offspring would torment me<br/>
With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt<br/>
Pursues me still-lest all I cannot die;<br/>
Lest that pure breath of life, the Spirit of Man<br/>
Which God inspired, cannot together perish<br/>
With this corporeal clod. Then, in the grave,<br/>
Or in some other dismal place, who knows<br/>
But I shall die a living death? O thought<br/>
Horrid, if true! Yet why? It was but breath<br/>
Of life that sinned: what dies but what had life<br/>
And sin? The body properly hath neither.<br/>
All of me, then, shall die: let this appease<br/>
The doubt, since human reach no further knows.<br/>
For, though the Lord of all be infinite,<br/>
Is his wrauth also? Be it, Man is not so,<br/>
But mortal doomed. But can he exercise<br/>
Wrauth without end on Man, whom death must end?<br/>
Can he make deathless death? That were to make<br/>
Strange contradiction; which to God himself<br/>
Impossible is held, as argument<br/>
Of weakness, not of power. Will he draw out,<br/>
For anger's sake, finite to infinite<br/>
In punished Man, to satisfy his rigour<br/>
Satisfied never? That were to extend<br/>
His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law;<br/>
By which all causes else according still<br/>
To the reception of their matter act,<br/>
Not to the extent of their own sphere. But say<br/>
That death be not one stroke, as I supposed,<br/>
Bereaving sense, but endless misery<br/>
From this day onward, which I feel begun<br/>
Both in me and without me, and so last<br/>
To perpetuity-Ay me! that fear<br/>
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution<br/>
On my defenceless head! Both Death and I<br/>
Am found eternal, and incorporate both:<br/>
Nor I on my part single; in me all<br/>
Posterity stands cursed. Fair patrimony<br/>
That I must leave ye, sons! Oh, were I able<br/>
To waste it all myself, and leave ye none!<br/>
So disinherited, how would ye bless<br/>
Me, now your curse! Ah, why should all Mankind,<br/>
For one man's fault, thus guiltless be condemned?<br/>
If guiltless! But from me what can proceed<br/>
But all corrupt-both mind and will depraved<br/>
Not to do only, but to will the same<br/>
With me? How can they, then, acquitted stand<br/>
In sight of God? Him, after all disputes,<br/>
Forced I absolve. All my evasions vain<br/>
And reasonings, though through mazes, lead me still<br/>
But to my own conviction: first and last<br/>
On me, me only, as the source and spring<br/>
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due.<br/>
So might the wrauth! Fond wish! could'st thou support<br/>
That burden, heavier than the Earth to bear—<br/>
Than all the world much heavier, though divided<br/>
With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desir'st,<br/>
And what thou fear'st, alike destroys all hope<br/>
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br/>
Beyond all past example and future—<br/>
To Satan only like, both crime and doom.<br/>
O Conscience! into what abyss of fears<br/>
And horrors hast thou driven me; out of which<br/>
I find no way, from deeper to deeper plunged!"

Thus Adam to himself lamented loud<br/>
Through the still night-not now, as ere Man fell,<br/>
Wholesome and cool and mild, but with black air<br/>
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom;<br/>
Which to his evil conscience represented<br/>
All things with double terror. On the ground<br/>
Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground, and oft<br/>
Cursed his creation; Death as oft accused<br/>
Of tardy execution, since denounced<br/>
The day of his offence. "Why comes not Death,"<br/>
Said he, "with one thrice-acceptable stroke<br/>
To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,<br/>
Justice divine not hasten to be just?<br/>
But Death comes not at call; Justice divine<br/>
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.<br/>
O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!<br/>
With other echo late I taught your shades<br/>
To answer, and resound far other song."<br/>
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,<br/>
Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,<br/>
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed;<br/>
But her, with stern regard, he thus repelled:—

"Out of my sight, thou Serpent! That name best<br/>
Befits thee, with him leagued, thyself as false<br/>
And hateful: nothing wants, but that thy shape<br/>
Like his, and colour serpentine, may shew<br/>
Thy inward fraud, to warn all creatures from thee<br/>
Henceforth, lest that too heavenly form, pretended<br/>
To hellish falsehood, snare them. But for thee<br/>
I had persisted happy, had not thy pride<br/>
And wandering vanity, when least was safe,<br/>
Rejected my forewarning, and disdained<br/>
Not to be trusted-longing to be seen,<br/>
Though by the Devil himself; him overweening<br/>
To overreach; but, with the Serpent meeting,<br/>
Fooled and beguiled; by him thou, I by thee,<br/>
To trust thee from my side, imagined wise,<br/>
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,<br/>
And understood not all was but a shew,<br/>
Rather than solid virtue, all but a rib<br/>
Crooked by nature-bent, as now appears,<br/>
More to the part sinister-from me drawn;<br/>
Well if thrown out, as supernumerary<br/>
To my just number found! O, why did God<br/>
Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven<br/>
With Spirits masculine, create at last<br/>
This novelty on Earth, this fair defect<br/>
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once<br/>
With men as Angels, without fiminine;<br/>
Or find some other way to generate<br/>
Mankind? This mischief had not then befallen,<br/>
And more that shall befall-innumerable<br/>
Disturbances on Earth through female snares,<br/>
And strait conjunction with this sex. For either<br/>
He never shall find out fit mate, but such<br/>
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake;<br/>
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain,<br/>
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained<br/>
By a far worse, or, if she love, withheld<br/>
By parents; or his happiest choice too late<br/>
Shall meet, already linked and wedlock-bound<br/>
To a fell adversary, his hate or shame:<br/>
Which infinite calamity shall cause<br/>
To human life, and household peace confound."

He added not, and from her turned; but Eve,<br/>
Not so repulsed, with tears that ceased not flowing,<br/>
And tresses all disordered, at his feet<br/>
Fell humble, and, imbracing them, besought<br/>
His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint:—

"Forsake me not thus, Adam! witness Heaven<br/>
What love sincere and reverence in my heart<br/>
I bear thee, and unweeting have offended,<br/>
Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant<br/>
I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not<br/>
Whereon I live, they gentle looks, thy aid,<br/>
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,<br/>
My only strength and stay. Forlorn of thee,<br/>
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?<br/>
While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,<br/>
Between us two let there be peace; both joining,<br/>
As joined in injuries, one enmity<br/>
Against a Foe by doom express assigned us.<br/>
That cruel Serpent. On me exercise not<br/>
Thy hatred for this misery befallen—<br/>
On me already lost, me than thyself<br/>
More miserable. Both have sinned; but thou<br/>
Against God only; I against God and thee,<br/>
And to the place of judgment will return,<br/>
There with my cries impor'tune Heaven, that all<br/>
The sentence, from thy head removed, may light<br/>
On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,<br/>
Me, me only, just object of His ire."

She ended, weeping; and her lowly plight,<br/>
Immovable till peace obtained from fault<br/>
Acknowledged and deplored, in Adam wraught<br/>
Commiseration. Soon his heart relented<br/>
Towards her, his life so late, and sole delight,<br/>
Now at his feet submissive in distress—<br/>
Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking,<br/>
His counsel whom she had displeased, his aid.<br/>
As one disarmed, his anger all he lost,<br/>
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon:—<br/>
"Unwary, and too desirous, as before<br/>
So now, of what thou know'st not, who desir'st<br/>
The punishment all on thyself! Alas!<br/>
Bear thine own first, ill able to sustain<br/>
His full wrauth whose thou feel'st as yet least part,<br/>
And my displeasure bear'st so ill. If prayers<br/>
Could alter high decrees, I to that place<br/>
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,<br/>
That on my head all might be visited,<br/>
Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven,<br/>
To me committed, and by me exposed.<br/>
But rise; let us no more contend, nor blame<br/>
Each other, blamed enough elsewhere, but strive<br/>
In offices of love how we may lighten<br/>
Each other's burden in our share of woe;<br/>
Since this day's death denounced, if aught I see,<br/>
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-paced evil,<br/>
A long day's dying, to augment our pain,<br/>
And to our seed (O hapless seed!) derived."

To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, replied:—<br/>
"Adam, by sad experiment I know<br/>
How little weight my words with thee can find,<br/>
Found so erroneous, thence by just event<br/>
Found so unfortunate. Nevertheless,<br/>
Restored by thee, vile as I am, to place<br/>
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regain<br/>
Thy love, the sole contentment of my heart,<br/>
Living or dying from thee I will not hide<br/>
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen,<br/>
Tending to some relief of our extremes,<br/>
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,<br/>
As in our evils, and of easier choice.<br/>
If care of our descent perplex us most,<br/>
Which must be born to certain woe, devoured<br/>
By Death at last (and miserable it is<br/>
To be to others cause of misery,<br/>
Our own begotten, and of our loins to bring<br/>
Into this cursed world a woeful race,<br/>
That, after wretched life, must be at last<br/>
Food for so foul a Monster), in thy power<br/>
It lies, yet ere conception, to prevent<br/>
The race unblest, to being yet unbegot.<br/>
Childless thou art; childless remain. So Death<br/>
Shall be deceived his glut, and with us two<br/>
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw.<br/>
But, if thou judge it hard and difficult,<br/>
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain<br/>
From love's due rites, nuptial imbraces sweet,<br/>
And with desire to languish without hope<br/>
Before the present object languishing<br/>
With like desire-which would be misery<br/>
And torment less than none of what we dread—<br/>
Then, both our selves and seed at once to free<br/>
From what we fear for both, let us make short;<br/>
Let us seek Death, or, he not found, supply<br/>
With our own hands his office on ourselves.<br/>
Why stand we longer shivering under fears<br/>
That shew no end but death, and have the power,<br/>
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing,<br/>
Destruction with destruction to destroy?"

She ended here, or vehement despair<br/>
Broke off the rest; so much of death her thoughts<br/>
Had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale.<br/>
But Adam, with such counsel nothing swayed,<br/>
To better hopes his more attentive mind<br/>
Labouring had raised, and thus to Eve replied:—

"Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems<br/>
To argue in thee something more sublime<br/>
And excellent than what thy mind contemns:<br/>
But self-destruction therefore sought refutes<br/>
That excellence thought in thee, and implies<br/>
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br/>
For loss of life and pleasure overloved.<br/>
Or, if thou covet death, as utmost end<br/>
Of misery, so thinking to evade<br/>
The penalty pronounced, doubt not but God<br/>
Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so<br/>
To be forestalled. Much more I fear lest death<br/>
So snatched will not exempt us from the pain<br/>
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts<br/>
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest<br/>
To make death in us live. Then let us seek<br/>
Some safer resolution-which methinks<br/>
I have in view, calling to mind with heed<br/>
Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise<br/>
The Serpent's head. Piteous amends! unless<br/>
Be meant whom I conjecture, our grand foe,<br/>
Satan, who in the Serpent hath contrived<br/>
Against us this deceit. To crush his head<br/>
Would be revenge indeed-which will be lost<br/>
By death brought on ourselves, or childless days<br/>
Resolved as thou proposest; so our foe<br/>
Shall scape his punishment ordained, and we<br/>
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.<br/>
No more be mentioned, then, of violence<br/>
Against ourselves, and wilful barrenness<br/>
That cuts us off from hope, and savours only<br/>
Rancour and pride, impatience and despite,<br/>
Reluctance against God and his just yoke<br/>
Laid on our necks. Remember with what mild<br/>
And gracious temper he both heard and judged,<br/>
Without wrauth or reviling. We expected<br/>
Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br/>
Was meant by death that day; when, lo! to thee<br/>
Pains only in child-bearing were foretold,<br/>
And bringing forth, soon recompensed with joy,<br/>
Fruit of thy womb. On me the curse aslope<br/>
Glanced on the ground. With labour I must earn<br/>
My bread; what harm? Idleness had been worse;<br/>
My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold<br/>
Or heat should injure us, his timely care<br/>
Hath, unbesought, provided, and his hands<br/>
Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged.<br/>
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br/>
Be open, and his heart to pity incline,<br/>
And teach us further by what means to shun<br/>
The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!<br/>
Which now the sky, with various face, begins<br/>
To shew us in this mountain, while the winds<br/>
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks<br/>
Of these fair spreading trees; which bids us seek<br/>
Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish<br/>
Our limbs benumbed-ere this diurnal star<br/>
Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams<br/>
Reflected may with matter sere foment,<br/>
Or by collision of two bodies grind<br/>
The air attrite to fire, as late the clouds,<br/>
Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,<br/>
Time the slant lightning, whose thwart flame, driven down,<br/>
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine,<br/>
And sends a comfortable heat from far,<br/>
Which might supply the Sun. Such fire to use,<br/>
And what may else be remedy or cure<br/>
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,<br/>
He will instruct us praying, and of grace<br/>
Beseeching him; so as we need not fear<br/>
To pass commodiously this life, sustained<br/>
By him with many comforts, till we end<br/>
In dust, our final rest and native home.<br/>
What better can we do than, to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall<br/>
Before him reverent, and there confess<br/>
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears<br/>
Watering the ground, and with our sighs the air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek?<br/>
Undoubtedly he will relent, and turn<br/>
From his displeasure, in whose look serene,<br/>
When angry most he seemed and most severe,<br/>
What else but favour, grace, and mercy shon?"

So spake our Father penitent; nor Eve<br/>
Felt less remorse. They, forthwith to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell<br/>
Before him reverent, and both confessed<br/>
Humbly their faults, and pardon begged, with tears<br/>
Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek.

<h2>Book 11</h2>

Thus they, in lowliest, plight, repentant stood<br/>
Praying; for from the Mercy-seat above<br/>
Prevenient grace descending had removed<br/>
The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh<br/>
Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breathed<br/>
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer<br/>
Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight<br/>
Than loudest oratory. Yet their port<br/>
Not of mean suitors; nor important less<br/>
Seemed their petition than when the ancient Pair<br/>
In fables old, less ancient yet than these,<br/>
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore<br/>
The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine<br/>
Of Themis stood devout. To Heaven their prayers<br/>
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds<br/>
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed<br/>
Dimensionless through heavenly doors; then, clad<br/>
With incense, where the Golden Altar fumed,<br/>
By their great Intercessor, came in sight<br/>
Before the Father's Throne. Them the glad Son<br/>
Presenting thus to intercede began:—

"See, Father, what first-fruits on Earth are sprung<br/>
From thy implanted grace in Man-these sighs<br/>
And prayers, which in this golden censer, mixed<br/>
With incense, I, thy priest, before thee bring;<br/>
Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed<br/>
Sown with contribution in his heart, than those<br/>
Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees<br/>
Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen<br/>
From innocence. Now, therefore, bend thine ear<br/>
To supplication; hear his sighs, though mute;<br/>
Unskilful with what words to pray, let me<br/>
Interpret for him, me his Advocate<br/>
And propitiation; all his works on me,<br/>
Good or not good, ingraft; my merit those<br/>
Shall perfet, and for these my death shall pay.<br/>
Accept me, and in me from these receive<br/>
The smell of peace toward Mankind; let him live,<br/>
Before thee reconciled, at least his days<br/>
Numbered, though sad, till death, his doom (which I<br/>
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse),<br/>
To better life shall yield him, where with me<br/>
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss,<br/>
Made one with me, as I with thee am one."

To whom the Father, without cloud, serene:—<br/>
"All thy request for Man, accepted Son,<br/>
Obtain; all thy request was my decree.<br/>
But longer in that Paradise to dwell<br/>
The law I gave to Nature him forbids;<br/>
Those pure immortal elements, that know<br/>
No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,<br/>
Eject him, tainted now, and purge him off,<br/>
As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,<br/>
And mortal food, as may dispose him best<br/>
For dissolution wrought by sin, that first<br/>
Distempered all things, and of incorrupt<br/>
Corrupted. I, at first, with two fair gifts<br/>
Created him endowed-with Happiness<br/>
And Immortality; that fondly lost,<br/>
This other served but to eternize woe,<br/>
Till I provided Death: so Death becomes<br/>
His final remedy, and, after life<br/>
Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined<br/>
By faith and faithful works, to second life,<br/>
Waked in the renovation of the just,<br/>
Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed.<br/>
But let us call to synod all the Blest<br/>
Through Heaven's wide bounds; from them I will not hide<br/>
My judgments-how with Mankind I proceed,<br/>
As how with peccant Angels late they saw,<br/>
And in their state, though firm, stood more confirmed."

He ended, and the Son gave signal high<br/>
To the bright Minister that watched. He blew<br/>
His trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps<br/>
When God descended, and perhaps once more<br/>
To sound at general doom. The angelic blast<br/>
Filled all the regions: from their blissful bowers<br/>
Of amarantin shade, fountain or spring,<br/>
By the waters of life, where'er they sate<br/>
In fellowships of joy, the Sons of Light<br/>
Hasted, resorting to the summons high,<br/>
And took their seats, till from his Throne supreme<br/>
The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will:—

"O Sons, like one of us Man is become<br/>
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste<br/>
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast<br/>
His knowledge of good lost and evil got,<br/>
Happier had it sufficed him to have known<br/>
Good by itself and evil not at all.<br/>
He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite—<br/>
My motions in him; longer than they move,<br/>
His heart I know how variable and vain,<br/>
Self-left. Lest, therefore, his now bolder hand<br/>
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,<br/>
And live for ever, dream at least to live<br/>
For ever, to remove him I decree,<br/>
And send him from the Garden forth, to till<br/>
The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil,<br/>
Michael, this my behest have thou in charge:<br/>
Take to thee from among the Cherubim<br/>
Thy choice of flaming warriors, lest the Fiend,<br/>
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade<br/>
Vacant possessions, some new trouble raise;<br/>
Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God<br/>
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair,<br/>
From hallowed ground the unholy, and denounce<br/>
To them, and to their progeny, from thence<br/>
Perpetual banishment. Yet, lest they faint<br/>
At the sad sentence rigorously urged<br/>
(For I behold them softened, and with tears<br/>
Bewailing their excess), all terror hide.<br/>
If patiently thy bidding they obey,<br/>
Dismiss them not disconsolate reveal<br/>
To Adam what shall come in future days,<br/>
As I shall thee enlighten; intermix<br/>
My covenant in the Woman's seed renewed.<br/>
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace;<br/>
And on the east side of the Garden place,<br/>
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,<br/>
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame<br/>
Wide-waving, all approach far off to fright,<br/>
And guard all passage to the Tree of life;<br/>
Lest Paradise a receptacle prove<br/>
To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey,<br/>
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude."

He ceased, and the Archangelic Power prepared<br/>
For swift descent; with him the cohort bright<br/>
Of watchful Cherubim. Four faces each<br/>
Had, like a double Janus; all their shape<br/>
Spangled with eyes more numerous than those<br/>
Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drowse,<br/>
Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed<br/>
Of Hermes, or his opiate rod. Meanwhile,<br/>
To resalute the World with sacred light,<br/>
Leucothea waked, and with fresh dews imbalmed<br/>
The Earth, when Adam and first matron Eve<br/>
Had ended now their orisons, and found<br/>
Strength added from above, new hope to spring<br/>
Out of despair, joy, but with fear yet linked;<br/>
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed:—

"Eve, easily may faith admit that all<br/>
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends;<br/>
But that from us aught should ascend to Heaven<br/>
So prevalent as to concern the mind<br/>
Of God high-blest, or to incline his will,<br/>
Hard to belief may seem. Yet this will prayer,<br/>
Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne<br/>
Even to the seat of God. For, since I sought<br/>
By prayer the offended Deity to appease,<br/>
Kneeled and before him humbled all my heart,<br/>
Methought I saw him placable and mild,<br/>
Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew<br/>
That I was heard with favour; peace returned<br/>
Home to my breast, and to my memory<br/>
His promise that thy seed shall bruise our Foe;<br/>
Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now<br/>
Assures me that the bitterness of death<br/>
Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee!<br/>
Eve rightly called, Mother of all Mankind,<br/>
Mother of all things living, since by thee<br/>
Man is to live, and all things live for Man."

To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek:—<br/>
"Ill-worthy I such title should belong<br/>
To me transgressor, who, for thee ordained<br/>
A help, became thy snare; to me reproach<br/>
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise.<br/>
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,<br/>
That I, who first brought death on all, am graced<br/>
The source of life; next favourable thou,<br/>
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf'st,<br/>
Far other name deserving. But the field<br/>
To labour calls us, now with sweat imposed,<br/>
Though after sleepless night; for see! the Morn,<br/>
All unconcerned with our unrest, begins<br/>
Her rosy progress smiling. Let us forth,<br/>
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,<br/>
Where'er our day's work lies, though now enjoined<br/>
Laborious, till day droop. While here we dwell,<br/>
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?<br/>
Here let us live, though in fallen state, content."

So spake, so wished, much-humbled Eve; but Fate<br/>
Subscribed not. Nature first gave signs, impressed<br/>
On bird, beast, air-air suddenly eclipsed,<br/>
After short blush of morn. Nigh in her sight<br/>
The bird of Jove, stooped from his aerie tour,<br/>
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove;<br/>
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,<br/>
First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,<br/>
Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind;<br/>
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.<br/>
Adam observed, and, with his eye the chase<br/>
Pursuing, not unmoved to Eve thus spake:—<br/>
"O Eve, some further change awaits us nigh,<br/>
Which Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shews,<br/>
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn<br/>
Us, haply too secure of our discharge<br/>
From penalty because from death released<br/>
Some days: how long, and what till then our life,<br/>
Who knows, or more than this, that we are dust,<br/>
And thither must return, and be no more?<br/>
Why else this double object in our sight,<br/>
Of flight pursued in the air and o'er the ground<br/>
One way the self-same hour? Why in the east<br/>
Darkness ere day's mid-course, and morning-light<br/>
More orient in yon western cloud, that draws<br/>
O'er the blue firmament a radiant white,<br/>
And slow descends, with something Heavenly fraught?"

He erred not; for, by this, the Heavenly bands<br/>
Down from a sky of jasper lighted now<br/>
In Paradise, and on a hill made halt—<br/>
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt<br/>
And carnal fear that day dimmed Adam's eye.<br/>
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met<br/>
Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw<br/>
The field pavilioned with his guardians bright;<br/>
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeared<br/>
In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,<br/>
Against the Syrian king, who, to surprise<br/>
One man, assassin-like, had levied war,<br/>
War unproclaimed. The princely Hierarch<br/>
In their bright stand there left his Powers to seize<br/>
Possession of the Garden; he alone,<br/>
To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,<br/>
Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve,<br/>
While the great Visitant approached, thus spake:—<br/>
"Eve, now expect great tidings, which, perhaps,<br/>
Of us will soon determine, or impose<br/>
New laws to be observed; for I descry,<br/>
From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,<br/>
One of the Heavenly host, and, by his gait,<br/>
None of the meanest-some great Potentate<br/>
Or of the Thrones above, such majesty<br/>
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,<br/>
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,<br/>
As Raphael, that I should much confide,<br/>
But solemn and sublime; whom, not to offend,<br/>
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire."

He ended; and the Archangel soon drew nigh,<br/>
Not in his shape celestial, but as man<br/>
Clad to meet man. Over his lucid arms<br/>
A military vest of purple flowed,<br/>
Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain<br/>
Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old<br/>
In time of truce; Iris had dipt the woof.<br/>
His starry helm unbuckled shewed him prime<br/>
In manhood where youth ended; by his side,<br/>
As in glistering zodiac, hung the sword,<br/>
Satan's dire dread, and in his hand the spear.<br/>
Adam bowed low; he, kingly, from his state<br/>
Inclined not, but his coming thus declared:—

"Adam, Heaven's high behest no preface needs.<br/>
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard, and Death,<br/>
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,<br/>
Defeated of his seizure many days,<br/>
Given thee of grace, wherein thou may'st repent,<br/>
And one bad act with many deeds well done<br/>
May'st cover. Well may then thy Lord, appeased,<br/>
Redeem thee quite from Death's rapacious claim;<br/>
But longer in this Paradise to dwell<br/>
Permits not. To remove thee I am come,<br/>
And send thee from the Garden forth, to till<br/>
The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil."<br/>
He added not; for Adam, at the news<br/>
Heart-strook, with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,<br/>
That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen<br/>
Yet all had heard, with audible lament<br/>
Discovered soon the place of her retire:—

"O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!<br/>
Must I thus leave thee, Paradise? thus leave<br/>
Thee, native soil? these happy walks and shades,<br/>
Fit haunt of Gods, where I had hope to spend,<br/>
Quiet, though sad, the respite of that day<br/>
That must be mortal to us both? O flowers,<br/>
That never will in other climate grow,<br/>
My early visitation, and my last<br/>
At even, which I bred up with tender hand<br/>
From the first opening bud, and gave ye names,<br/>
Who now shall rear ye to the Sun, or rank<br/>
Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?<br/>
Thee, lastly, nuptial bower, by me adorned<br/>
With what to sight or smell was sweet, from thee<br/>
How shall I part, and whither wander down<br/>
Into a lower world, to this obscure<br/>
And wild? How shall we breathe in other air<br/>
Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?"

Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild:<br/>
"Lament not, Eve, but patiently resign<br/>
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,<br/>
Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine.<br/>
Thy going is not lonely; with thee goes<br/>
Thy husband; him to follow thou art bound;<br/>
Where he abides, t iok there thy native soil."

Adam, by this from the cold sudden damp<br/>
Recovering, and his scattered spirits returned,<br/>
To Michael thus his humble words addressed:—

"Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named<br/>
Of them the highest-for such of shape may seem<br/>
Prince above princes-gently hast thou told<br/>
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,<br/>
And in performing end us. What besides<br/>
Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair,<br/>
Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring—<br/>
Departure from this happy place, our sweet<br/>
Recess, and only consolation left<br/>
Familiar to our eyes; all places else<br/>
Inhospitable appear, and desolate,<br/>
Nor knowing us, nor known. And, if by prayer<br/>
Incessant I could hope to change the will<br/>
Of Him who all things can, I would not cease<br/>
To weary him with my assiduous cries;<br/>
But prayer against his absolute decree<br/>
No more avails than breath against the wind,<br/>
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:<br/>
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.<br/>
This most afflicts me-that, departing hence,<br/>
As from his face I shall be hid, deprived<br/>
His blessed countenance. Here I could frequent,<br/>
With worship, place by place where he voutsafed<br/>
Presence Divine, and to my sons relate,<br/>
'On this mount He appeared; under this tree<br/>
Stood visible; among these pines his voice<br/>
I heard; here with him at this fountain talked.'<br/>
So many grateful altars I would rear<br/>
Of grassy turf, and pile up every stone<br/>
Of lustre from the brook, in memory<br/>
Or monument to ages, and thereon<br/>
Offer sweet-smelling gums, and fruits, and flowers.<br/>
In yonder nether world where shall I seek<br/>
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?<br/>
For, though I fled him angry, yet, recalled<br/>
To life prolonged and promised race, I now<br/>
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts<br/>
Of glory, and far off his steps adore."

To whom thus Michael, with regard benign:—<br/>
"Adam, thou know'st Heaven his, and all the Earth,<br/>
Not this rock only; his omnipresence fills<br/>
Land, sea, and air, and every kind that lives,<br/>
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed.<br/>
All the Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,<br/>
No despicable gift; surmise not, then,<br/>
His presence to these narrow bounds confined<br/>
Of Paradise or Eden. This had been<br/>
Perhaps thy capital seat, from whence had spread<br/>
All generations, and had hither come,<br/>
From all the ends of the Earth, to celebrate<br/>
And reverence thee their great progenitor.<br/>
But this pre-eminence thou hast lost, brought down<br/>
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons:<br/>
Yet doubt not but in valley and in plain<br/>
God is, as here, and will be found alike<br/>
Present, and of his presence many a sign<br/>
Still following thee, still compassing thee round<br/>
With goodness and paternal love, his face<br/>
Express, and of his steps the track divine.<br/>
Which that thou may'st believe, and be confirmed<br/>
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent<br/>
To shew thee what shall come in future days<br/>
To thee and to thy offspring. Good with bad<br/>
Expect to hear, supernal grace contending<br/>
With sinfulness of men-thereby to learn<br/>
True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br/>
And pious sorrow, equally inured<br/>
By moderation either state to bear,<br/>
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br/>
Safest thy life, and best prepared endure<br/>
Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend<br/>
This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)<br/>
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,<br/>
As once thou slept'st while she to life was formed."

To whom thus Adam gratefully replied:—<br/>
"Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path<br/>
Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heaven submit,<br/>
However chastening-to the evil turn<br/>
My obvious breast, arming to overcome<br/>
By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,<br/>
If so I may attain." So both ascend<br/>
In the Visions of God. It was a hill,<br/>
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top<br/>
The hemisphere of Earth is clearest ken<br/>
Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay.<br/>
Not higher that hill, nor wider looking ground,<br/>
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set<br/>
Our second Adam, in the wilderness,<br/>
To shew him all Earth's kingdoms and their glory.<br/>
His eye might there command wherever stood<br/>
City of old or modern fame, the seat<br/>
Of mightiest empire, from the destined walls<br/>
Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can,<br/>
And Samarchand by Oxus, Temir's throne,<br/>
To Pacquin, of Sinaean kings, and thence<br/>
To Agra and Lahor of Great Mogul,<br/>
Down to the golden Chersonese, or where<br/>
The Persian in Ecbatan sat, or since<br/>
In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar<br/>
In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance,<br/>
Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken<br/>
The empire of Negus to his utmost port<br/>
Ercoco, and the less maritime kings,<br/>
Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind,<br/>
And Sofala (thought Ophir), to the realm<br/>
Of Congo, and Angola fardest south,<br/>
Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount,<br/>
The kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus,<br/>
Marocco, and Algiers, and Tremisen;<br/>
On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway,<br/>
The world: in spirit perhaps he also saw<br/>
Rich Mexico, the seat of Montezume,<br/>
And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat<br/>
Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoiled<br/>
Guiana, whose great city Geryon's sons<br/>
Call El Dorado. But to nobler sights<br/>
Michael from Adam's eyes the film removed<br/>
Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight<br/>
Had bred; then purged with euphrasy and rue<br/>
The visual nerve, for he had much to see,<br/>
And from the well of life three drops instilled.<br/>
So deep the power of these ingredients pierced,<br/>
Even to the inmost seat of mental sight,<br/>
That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,<br/>
Sunk down, and all his spirits became intranced.<br/>
But him the gentle Angel by the hand<br/>
Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled:—

"Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold<br/>
The effects which thy original crime hath wrought<br/>
In some to spring from thee, who never touched<br/>
The excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspired,<br/>
Nor sinned thy sin, yet from that sin derive<br/>
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds."

His eyes he opened, and beheld a field,<br/>
Part arable and tilth, whereon were sheaves<br/>
New-reaped, the other part sheep-walks and folds:<br/>
I' the midst an altar as the landmark stood,<br/>
Rustic, of grassy sord. Thither anon<br/>
A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought<br/>
First-fruits, the green ear and the yellow sheaf,<br/>
Unculled, as came to hand. A shepherd next,<br/>
More meek, came with the firstlings of his flock,<br/>
Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid<br/>
The inwards and their fat, with incense strewed,<br/>
On the cleft wood, and all due rites performed.<br/>
His offering soon propitious fire from heaven<br/>
Consumed, with nimble glance and grateful steam;<br/>
The other's not, for his was not sincere:<br/>
Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talked,<br/>
Smote him into the midriff with a stone<br/>
That beat out life; he fell, and, deadly pale,<br/>
Groaned out his soul, with gushing blood effused.<br/>
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart<br/>
Dismayed, and thus in haste to the Angel cried:—

"O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen<br/>
To that meek man, who well had sacrificed:<br/>
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?

To whom Michael thus, he also moved, replied:—<br/>
"These two are brethren, Adam, and to come<br/>
Out of thy loins. The unjust the just hath slain,<br/>
For envy that his brother's offering found<br/>
From Heaven acceptance; but the bloody fact<br/>
Will be avenged, and the other's faith approved<br/>
Lose no reward, though here thou see him die,<br/>
Rowling in dust and gore." To which our Sire:—

"Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!<br/>
But have I now seen Death? Is this the way<br/>
I must return to native dust? O sight<br/>
Of terror, foul and ugly to behold!<br/>
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!

To whom thus Michael:—"Death thou hast seen<br/>
In his first shape on Man; but many shapes<br/>
Of Death, and many are the ways that lead<br/>
To his grim cave-all dismal, yet to sense<br/>
More terrible at the entrance than within.<br/>
Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,<br/>
By fire, flood, famine; by intemperance more<br/>
In meats and drinks, which on the Earth shall bring<br/>
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br/>
Before thee shall appear, that thou may'st know<br/>
What misery the inabstinence of Eve<br/>
Shall bring on me." Immediately a place<br/>
Before his eyes appeared, sad, noisome, dark;<br/>
A lazar-house it seemed, wherein were laid<br/>
Numbers of all diseased-all maladies<br/>
Of ghastly spasm, of racking torture, qualms<br/>
Of heart-sick-agony, all feverous kinds,<br/>
Convulsions, epilepsies, fierce catarrhs,<br/>
Intestine stone and ulcer, colic pangs,<br/>
Daemoniac phrenzy, moping melancholy,<br/>
And moon-struck madness, pining atrophy,<br/>
Marasmus, and wide-wasting pestilence,<br/>
Dropsies and asthmas, and joint-racking rheums.<br/>
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans; Despair<br/>
Tended the sick, busiest from couch to couch;<br/>
And over them triumphant Death his dart<br/>
Shook, but delayed to strike, though oft invoked<br/>
With vows, as their chief good and final hope.<br/>
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long<br/>
Dry-eyed behold? Adam could not, but wept,<br/>
Though not of woman born: compassion quelled<br/>
His best of man, and gave him up to tears<br/>
A space, till firmer thoughts restrained excess,<br/>
And, scarce recovering words, his plaint renewed:—

"O miserable Mankind, to what fall<br/>
Degraded, to what wretched state reserved!<br/>
Better end here unborn. Why is life given<br/>
To be thus wrested from us? rather why<br/>
Obtruded on us thus? who, if we knew<br/>
What we receive would either not accept<br/>
Life offered, or soon beg to lay it down,<br/>
Glad to be so dismissed in peace. Can thus<br/>
The image of God in Man, created once<br/>
So goodly and erect, though faulty since,<br/>
To such unsightly sufferings be debased<br/>
Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,<br/>
Retaining still divine similitude<br/>
In part, from such deformities be free,<br/>
And for his Maker's image' sake exempt?"

"Their Maker's image," answered Michael, "then<br/>
Forsook them, when themselves they vilified<br/>
To serve ungoverned Appetite, and took<br/>
His image whom they served-a brutish vice,<br/>
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve.<br/>
Therefore so abject is their punishment,<br/>
Disfiguring not God's likeness, but their own;<br/>
Or, if his likeness, by themselves defaced<br/>
While they pervert pure Nature's healthful rules<br/>
To loathsome sickness-worthily, since they<br/>
God's image did not reverence in themselves."

"I yield it just," said Adam, "and submit.<br/>
But is there yet no other way, besides<br/>
These painful passages, how we may come<br/>
To death, and mix with our connatural dust?"

"There is," said Michael, "if thou well observe<br/>
The rule of Not too much, by temperance taught<br/>
In what thou eat'st and drink'st, seeking from thence<br/>
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,<br/>
Till many years over thy head return.<br/>
So may'st thou live, till, like ripe fruit, thou drop<br/>
Into thy mother's lap, or be with ease<br/>
Gathered, not harshly plucked, for death mature.<br/>
This is old age; but then thou must outlive<br/>
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change<br/>
To withered, weak, and grey; thy senses then,<br/>
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgo<br/>
To what thou hast; and, for the air of youth,<br/>
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reign<br/>
A melancholy damp of cold and dry,<br/>
To weigh thy spirits down, and last consume<br/>
The balm of life." To whom our Ancestor:—

"Henceforth I fly not death, nor would prolong<br/>
Life much-bent rather how I may be quit,<br/>
Fairest and easiest, of this cumbrous charge,<br/>
Which I must keep till my appointed day<br/>
Of rendering up, and patiently attend<br/>
My dissolution." Michael replied:—

"Nor love thy life, nor hate; but what thou liv'st<br/>
Live well, how long or short permit to Heaven.<br/>
And now prepare thee for another sight."

He looked, and saw a spacious plain, whereon<br/>
Were tents of various hue: by some were herds<br/>
Of cattle grazing: others whence the sound<br/>
Of instruments that made melodious chime<br/>
Was heard, of harp and organ, and who moved<br/>
Their stops and chords was seen: his volant touch<br/>
Instinct through all proportions low and high<br/>
Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue.<br/>
In other part stood one who, at the forge<br/>
Labouring, two massy clods of iron and brass<br/>
Had melted (whether found where casual fire<br/>
Had wasted woods, on mountain or in vale,<br/>
Down to the veins of earth, thence gliding hot<br/>
To some cave's mouth, or whether washed by stream<br/>
From underground); the liquid ore he drained<br/>
Into fit moulds prepared; from which he formed<br/>
First his own tools, then what might else be wrought<br/>
Fusil or graven in metal. After these,<br/>
But on the hither side, a different sort<br/>
From the high neighbouring hills, which was their seat,<br/>
Down to the plain descended: by their guise<br/>
Just men they seemed, and all their study bent<br/>
To worship God aright, and know his works<br/>
Not hid; nor those things last which might preserve<br/>
Freedom and peace to men. They on the plain<br/>
Long had not walked when from the tents behold<br/>
A bevy of fair women, richly gay<br/>
In gems and wanton dress! to the harp they sung<br/>
Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on.<br/>
The men, though grave, eyed them, and let their eyes<br/>
Rove without rein, till, in the amorous net<br/>
Fast caught, they liked, and each his liking chose.<br/>
And now of love they treat, till the evening-star,<br/>
Love's harbinger, appeared; then, all in heat,<br/>
They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke<br/>
Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:<br/>
With feast and music all the tents resound.<br/>
Such happy interview, and fair event<br/>
Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,<br/>
And charming symphonies, attached the heart<br/>
Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,<br/>
The bent of Nature; which he thus expressed:

"True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,<br/>
Much better seems this vision, and more hope<br/>
Of peaceful days portends, than those two past:<br/>
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse;<br/>
Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends."

To whom thus Michael:—"Judge not what is best<br/>
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,<br/>
Created, as thou art, to nobler end,<br/>
Holy and pure, conformity divine.<br/>
Those tents thou saw'st so pleasant were the tents<br/>
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his race<br/>
Who slew his brother: studious they appear<br/>
Of arts that polish life, inventors rare;<br/>
Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit<br/>
Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledged none.<br/>
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget;<br/>
For that fair female troop thou saw'st, that seemed<br/>
Of goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,<br/>
Yet empty of all good wherein consists<br/>
Woman's domestic honour and chief praise;<br/>
Bred only and completed to the taste<br/>
Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance,<br/>
To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye:—<br/>
To these that sober race of men, whose lives<br/>
Religious titled them the Sons of God,<br/>
Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame,<br/>
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles<br/>
Of these fair atheists, and now swim in joy<br/>
(Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which<br/>
The world erelong a world of tears must weep."

To whom thus Adam, of short joy bereft:—<br/>
"O pity and shame, that they who to live well<br/>
Entered so fair should turn aside to tread<br/>
Paths indirect, or in the midway faint!<br/>
But still I see the tenor of Man's woe<br/>
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin."

"From Man's effeminate slackness it begins,"<br/>
Said the Angel, "who should better hold his place<br/>
By wisdom, and superior gifts received.<br/>
But now prepare thee for another scene."

He looked, and saw wide territory spread<br/>
Before him-towns, and rural works between,<br/>
Cities of men with lofty gates and towers,<br/>
Concourse in arms, fierce faces threatening war,<br/>
Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise.<br/>
Part wield their arms, part curb the foaming steed,<br/>
Single or in array of battle ranged<br/>
Both horse and foot, nor idly mustering stood.<br/>
One way a band select from forage drives<br/>
A herd of beeves, fair oxen and fair kine,<br/>
From a fat meadow-ground, or fleecy flock,<br/>
Ewes and their bleating lambs, over the plain,<br/>
Their booty; scarce with life the shepherds fly,<br/>
But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray:<br/>
With cruel tournament the squadrons join;<br/>
Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies<br/>
With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field<br/>
Deserted. Others to a city strong<br/>
Lay siege, encamped, by battery, scale, and mine,<br/>
Assaulting; others from the wall defend<br/>
With dart and javelin, stones and sulphurous fire;<br/>
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.<br/>
In other parts the sceptred haralds call<br/>
To council in the city-gates: anon<br/>
Grey-headed men and grave, with warriors mixed,<br/>
Assemble, and harangues are heard; but soon<br/>
In factious opposition, till at last<br/>
Of middle age one rising, eminent<br/>
In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,<br/>
Of justice, of religion, truth, and peace,<br/>
And judgment from above: him old and young<br/>
Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,<br/>
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence,<br/>
Unseen amid the throng. So violence<br/>
Proceeded, and oppression, and sword-law,<br/>
Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.<br/>
Adam was all in tears; and to his guide<br/>
Lamenting turned full sad:—"Oh, what are these?<br/>
Death's ministers, not men! who thus deal death<br/>
Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br/>
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew<br/>
His brother; for of whom such massacre<br/>
Make they but of their brethren, men of men?<br/>
But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven<br/>
Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?"

To whom thus Michael:—"These are the product'<br/>
Of those ill-mated marriages thou saw'st,<br/>
Where good with bad were matched; who of themselves<br/>
Abhor to join, and, by imprudence mixed,<br/>
Produce prodigious births of body or mind.<br/>
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;<br/>
For in those days might only shall be admired,<br/>
And valour and heroic virtue called.<br/>
To overcome in battle, and subdue<br/>
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite<br/>
Manslaughter, shall be held the highest pitch<br/>
Of human glory, and, for glory done,<br/>
Of triumph to be styled great conquerors,<br/>
Patrons of mankind, gods, and sons of gods—<br/>
Destroyers rightlier called, and Plagues of men.<br/>
Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth,<br/>
And what most merits fame in silence hid.<br/>
But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheld'st<br/>
The only righteous in a world perverse,<br/>
And therefore hated, therefore so beset<br/>
With foes, for daring single to be just,<br/>
And utter odious truth, that God would come<br/>
To judge them with his Saints-him the Most High,<br/>
Rapt in a balmy cloud, with winged steeds,<br/>
Did, as thou saw'st, receive, to walk with God<br/>
High in salvation and the climes of bliss,<br/>
Exempt from death, to show thee what reward<br/>
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;<br/>
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold."

He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed.<br/>
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar;<br/>
All now was turned to jollity and game,<br/>
To luxury and riot, feast andndance,<br/>
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,<br/>
Rape or adultery, where passing fair<br/>
Allured them; thence form cups to civil broils.<br/>
At length a reverend Sire among them came,<br/>
And of their doings great dislike declared,<br/>
And testified against their ways. He oft<br/>
Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,<br/>
Triumphs or festivals, and to them preached<br/>
Conversion and repentance, as to souls<br/>
In prison, under judgments imminent;<br/>
But all in vain. Which when he saw, he ceased<br/>
Contending, and removed his tents far off;<br/>
Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,<br/>
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,<br/>
Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth,<br/>
Smeared round with pitch, and in the side a door<br/>
Contrived, and of provisions laid in large<br/>
For man and beast: when lo! a wonder strange!<br/>
Of every beast, and bird, and insect small<br/>
Came sevens and pairs, and entered in, as taught<br/>
Their order; last, the Sire and his three sons,<br/>
With their four wives; and God made fast the door.<br/>
Meanwhile the South-wind rose, and, with black wings<br/>
Wide-hovering, all the clouds together drove<br/>
From under heaven; the hills to their supply<br/>
Vapour, and exhalation dusk and moist,<br/>
Sent up amain; and now the thickened sky<br/>
Like a dark ceiling stood: down rushed the rain<br/>
Impetuous, and continued till the earth<br/>
No more was seen. The floating Vessel swum<br/>
Uplifted, and secure with beaked prow<br/>
Rode tilting o'er the waves; all dwellings else<br/>
Flood overwhelmed, and them with all their pomp<br/>
Deep under water rowled; sea covered sea,<br/>
Sea without shore: and in their palaces,<br/>
Where luxury late reigned, sea-monsters whelped<br/>
And stabled: of mankind, so numerous late,<br/>
All left in one small bottom swum imbarked.<br/>
How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold<br/>
The end of all thy offspring, end so sad,<br/>
Depopulation! Thee another flood,<br/>
Of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned,<br/>
And sunk thee as thy sons; till, gently reared<br/>
By the Angel, on thy feet thou stood'st at last,<br/>
Though comfortless, as when a father mourns<br/>
His children, all in view destroyed at once,<br/>
And scarce to the Angel utter'dst thus thy plaint:—

"O Visions ill foreseen! Better had I<br/>
Lived ignorant of future-so had borne<br/>
My part of evil only, each day's lot<br/>
Enough to bear. Those now that were dispensed<br/>
The burden of many ages on me light<br/>
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining birth<br/>
Abortive, to torment me, ere their being,<br/>
With thought that they must be. Let no man seek<br/>
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall<br/>
Him or his children-evil, he may be sure,<br/>
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,<br/>
And he the future evil shall no less<br/>
In apprehension than in substance feel<br/>
Grievous to bear. But that care now is past;<br/>
Man is not whom to warn; those few escaped<br/>
Famine and anguish will at last consume,<br/>
Wandering that watery desert. I had hope,<br/>
When violence was ceased and war on Earth,<br/>
All would have then gone well, peace would have crowned<br/>
With length of happy days the race of Man;<br/>
But I was far deceived, for now I see<br/>
Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste.<br/>
How comes it thus? Unfold, Celestial Guide,<br/>
And whether here the race of Man will end."

To whom thus Michael:—"Those whom last thou saw'st<br/>
In triumph and luxurious wealth are they<br/>
First seen in acts of powers eminent<br/>
And great exploits, but of true virtue void;<br/>
Who, having split much blood, and done much waste,<br/>
Subduing nations, and achieved thereby<br/>
Fame in the world, high titles, and rich prey,<br/>
Shall change their course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,<br/>
Surfeit, and lust, till wantonness and pride<br/>
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace.<br/>
The conquered, also, and enslaved by war,<br/>
Shall, with their freedom lost, all virtue lose,<br/>
And fear of God-from whom their piety feigned<br/>
In sharp contest of battle found no aid<br/>
Against invaders; therefore, cooled in zeal,<br/>
Thenceforth shall practise how to live secure,<br/>
Worldly, or dissolute, on what their lords<br/>
Shall leave them to enjoy; for the Earth shall bear<br/>
More than enough, that temperance may be tried.<br/>
So all shall turn degenerate, all depraved,<br/>
Justice and temperance, truth and faith, forgot;<br/>
One man except, the only son of light<br/>
In a dark age, against example good,<br/>
Against allurement, custom, and a world<br/>
Offended. Fearless of reproach and scorn,<br/>
Or violence, he of their wicked ways<br/>
Shall them admonish, and before them set<br/>
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe<br/>
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come<br/>
On their impenitence, and shall return<br/>
Of them derided, but of God observed<br/>
The one just man alive: by his command<br/>
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheld'st,<br/>
To save himself and household from amidst<br/>
A world devote to universal wrack.<br/>
No sooner he, with them of man and beast<br/>
Select for life, shall in the ark be lodged<br/>
And sheltered round, but all the cataracts<br/>
Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour<br/>
Rain day and night; all fountains of the deep,<br/>
Broke up, shall heaven the ocean to usurp<br/>
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise<br/>
Above the highest hills. Then shall this Mount<br/>
Of Paradise by might of waves be moved<br/>
Out of his place, pushed by the horned flood,<br/>
With all his verdure spoiled, and trees adrift,<br/>
Down the great River to the opening Gulf,<br/>
And there take root, and island salt and bare,<br/>
The haunt of seals, and orcs, and sea-mews' clang—<br/>
To teach thee that God at'tributes to place<br/>
No sanctity, if none be thither brought<br/>
By men who there frequent or therein dwell.<br/>
And now what further shall ensue behold."

He looked, and saw the Ark hull on the flood,<br/>
Which now abated; for the clouds were fled.<br/>
Driven by a keen North-wind, that, blowing dry,<br/>
Wrinkled the face of Deluge, as decayed;<br/>
And the clear sun on his wide watery glass<br/>
Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,<br/>
As after thirst; which made their flowing shrink<br/>
From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole<br/>
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt<br/>
His sluices, as the heaven his windows shut. .<br/>
The Ark no more now floats, but seems on ground,<br/>
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.<br/>
And now the tops of hills as rocks appear;<br/>
With clamour thence the rapid currents drive<br/>
Towards the retreating sea their furious tide.<br/>
Forthwith from out the ark a Raven flies.<br/>
And, after him, the surer messenger,<br/>
A Dove, sent forth once and again to spy<br/>
Green tree or ground whereon his foot may light;<br/>
The second time returning, in his bill<br/>
An olive-leaf he brings, pacific sign.<br/>
Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark<br/>
The ancient sire descends, with all this train;<br/>
Then, with uplifted hands and eyes devout,<br/>
Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds<br/>
A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a Bow<br/>
Conspicuous with three listed colours gay,<br/>
Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.<br/>
Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,<br/>
Greatly rejoiced; and thus his joy broke forth:—

"O thou, who future things cants represent<br/>
As present, Heavenly Instructor, I revive<br/>
At this last sight, assured that Man shall live,<br/>
With all the creatures, and their seed preserve.<br/>
Far less I now lament for one whole world<br/>
Of wicked sons destroyed that I rejoice<br/>
For one man found so perfet and so just<br/>
That God voutsafes to raise another world<br/>
From him, and all his anger to forget.<br/>
But say what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven:<br/>
Distended as the brow of God appeased?<br/>
Or serve they as a flowery verge to bind<br/>
The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud,<br/>
Lest it again dissolve and shower the Earth?"

To whom the Archangel:—"Dextrously thou aim'st.<br/>
So willingly doth God remit his ire:<br/>
Though late repenting him of Man depraved,<br/>
Grieved at his heart, when, looking down, he saw<br/>
The whole Earth filled with violence, and all flesh<br/>
Corrupting each their way; yet, those removed,<br/>
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight<br/>
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,<br/>
And makes a covenant never to destroy<br/>
The Earth again by flood, nor let the sea<br/>
Surpass his bounds, nor rain to drown the world<br/>
With man therein or beast: but, when he brings<br/>
Over the Earth a cloud, with therein set<br/>
His triple-coloured bow, whereon to look<br/>
And call to mind his Covenant. Day and night,<br/>
Seed-time and harvest, heat and hoary frost,<br/>
Shall hold their course, till fire purge all things new<br/>
Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell."

<h2>Book 12</h2>

As one who, in his journey, bates at noon,<br/>
Though bent on speed, so here the Archangel paused<br/>
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,<br/>
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;<br/>
Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes:—

"Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end,<br/>
And Man as from a second stock proceed.<br/>
Much thou hast yet to see; but I perceive<br/>
Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine<br/>
Must needs impair and weary human sense.<br/>
Henceforth what is to come I will relate;<br/>
Thou, therefore, give due audience, and attend.

"This second source of men, while yet but few,<br/>
And while the dread of judgment past remains<br/>
Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,<br/>
With some regard to what is just and right<br/>
Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace,<br/>
Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,<br/>
Corn, wine and oil; and, from the herd or flock<br/>
Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,<br/>
With large wine-offerings poured, and sacred feast,<br/>
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed, and dwell<br/>
Long time in peace, by families and tribes,<br/>
Under paternal rule, till one shall rise,<br/>
Of proud, ambitious heart, who, not content<br/>
With fair equality, fraternal state,<br/>
Will arrogate dominion undeserved<br/>
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess<br/>
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth—<br/>
Hunting (and men, not beasts, shall be his game)<br/>
With war and hostile snare such as refuse<br/>
Subjection to his empire tyrannous.<br/>
A mighty Hunter thence he shall be styled<br/>
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heaven,<br/>
Or from Heaven claiming second sovranty,<br/>
And from rebellion shall derive his name,<br/>
Though of rebellion others he accuse.

He, with a crew, whom like ambition joins<br/>
With him or under him to tyrannize,<br/>
Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find<br/>
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge<br/>
Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell.<br/>
Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build<br/>
A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven;<br/>
And get themselves a name, lest far dispersed<br/>
In foreign lands, their memory be lost—<br/>
Regardless whether good or evil fame.<br/>
But God, who oft descends to visit men<br/>
Unseen, and through their habitations walks,<br/>
To mark their doings, them beholding soon,<br/>
Comes down to see their city, ere the Tower<br/>
Obstruct Heaven-towers, and in derision sets<br/>
Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase<br/>
Quite out their native language, and, instead,<br/>
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown.<br/>
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud<br/>
Among the builders; each to other calls,<br/>
Not understood-till, hoarse and all in rage,<br/>
As mocked they storm. Great laughter was in Heaven,<br/>
And looking down to see the hubbub strange<br/>
And hear the din. Thus was the building left<br/>
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named."

Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased:—<br/>
"O execrable son, so to aspire<br/>
Above his brethren, to himself assuming<br/>
Authority usurped, from God not given!<br/>
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,<br/>
Dominion absolute; that right we hold<br/>
By his donation: but man over men<br/>
He made not lord-such title to himself<br/>
Reserving, human left from human free.<br/>
But this Usurper his encroachment proud<br/>
Stays not on Man; to God his Tower intends<br/>
Siege and defiance. Wretched man! what food<br/>
Will he convey up thither, to sustain<br/>
Himself and his rash army, where thin air<br/>
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,<br/>
And famish him of breath, if not of bread?"

To whom thus Michael:—"Justly thou abhorr'st<br/>
That son, who on the quiet state of men<br/>
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue<br/>
Rational liberty; yet know withal,<br/>
Since thy original lapse, true liberty<br/>
Is lost, which always with right reason dwells<br/>
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being.<br/>
Reason in Man obscured, or not obeyed,<br/>
Immediately inordinate desires<br/>
And upstart passions catch the government<br/>
From Reason, and to servitude reduce<br/>
Man, till then free. Therefore, since he permits<br/>
Within himself unworthy powers to reign<br/>
Over free reason, God, in judgment just,<br/>
Subjects him from without to violent lords,<br/>
Who oft as undeservedly enthral<br/>
His outward freedom. Tyranny must be,<br/>
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.<br/>
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low<br/>
From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,<br/>
But justice and some fatal curse annexed,<br/>
Deprives them of their outward liberty,<br/>
Their inward lost: witness the irreverent son<br/>
Of him who built the Ark, who, for the shame<br/>
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,<br/>
Servant of servants, on his vicious race.<br/>
Thus will this latter, as the former world,<br/>
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last,<br/>
Wearied with their iniquities, withdlaw<br/>
His presence from among them, and avert<br/>
His holy eyes, resolving from thenceforth<br/>
To leave them to their own polluted ways,<br/>
And one peculiar nation to select<br/>
From all the rest, of whom to be invoked—<br/>
A nation from one faithful man to spring.<br/>
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,<br/>
Bred up in idol-worship-Oh, that men<br/>
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br/>
While yet the patriarch lived who scaped the Flood,<br/>
As to forsake the living God, and fall<br/>
To worship their own work in wood and stone<br/>
For gods!-yet him God the Most High voutsafes<br/>
To call by vision from his father's house,<br/>
His kindred, and false gods into a land<br/>
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise<br/>
A mighty nation, and upon him shower<br/>
His benediction so that in his seed<br/>
All Nations shall be blest. He straight obeys;<br/>
Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes.<br/>
I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith<br/>
He leaves his gods, his friends, and native soil,<br/>
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford<br/>
To Haran-after him a cumbrous train<br/>
Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude—<br/>
Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth<br/>
With God, who called him, in a land unknown<br/>
Canaan he now attains; I see his tents<br/>
Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain<br/>
Of Moreh. There, by promise, he receives<br/>
Gift to his progeny of all that land,<br/>
From Hamath northward to the Desert south<br/>
(Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed),<br/>
From Hermon east to the great western sea;<br/>
Mount Hermon, yonder sea, each place behold<br/>
In prospect, as I point them: on the shore,<br/>
Mount Carmel; here, the double-founted stream,<br/>
Jordan, true limit eastward; but his sons<br/>
Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of hills.<br/>
This ponder, that all nations of the Earth<br/>
Shall in his seed be blessed. By that seed<br/>
Is meant thy great Deliverer, who shall bruise<br/>
The Serpent's head; whereof to thee anon<br/>
Plainlier shall be revealed. This patriarch blest,<br/>
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call,<br/>
A son, and of his son a grandchild, leaves,<br/>
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown.<br/>
The grandchild, with twelve sons increased, departs<br/>
From Canaan to a land hereafter called<br/>
Egypt, divided by the river Nile;<br/>
See where it flows, disgorging at seven mouths<br/>
Into the sea, To sojourn in that land<br/>
He comes, invited by a younger son<br/>
In time of dearth-a son whose worthy deeds<br/>
Raise him to be the second in that realm<br/>
Of Pharaoh. There he dies, and leaves his race<br/>
Growing into a nation, and now grown<br/>
Suspected to a sequent king, who seeks<br/>
To stop their overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves,<br/>
Inhospitably, and kills their infant males:<br/>
Till, by two brethren (those two brethren call<br/>
Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claim<br/>
His people from enthralment, they return,<br/>
With glory and spoil, back to their promised land.<br/>
But first the lawless tyrant, who denies<br/>
To know their God, or message to regard,<br/>
Must be compelled by signs and judgments dire:<br/>
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned;<br/>
Frogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill<br/>
With loathed intrusion, and fill all the land;<br/>
His cattle must of rot and murrain die;<br/>
Botches and blains must all his flesh imboss,<br/>
And all his people; thunder mixed with hail,<br/>
Hail mixed with fire, must rend the Egyptian sky,<br/>
And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls;<br/>
What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,<br/>
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down<br/>
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green;<br/>
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,<br/>
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days;<br/>
Last, with one midnight-stroke, all the first-born<br/>
Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds<br/>
The River-dragon tamed at length submits<br/>
To let his sojourners depart, and oft<br/>
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as ice<br/>
More hardened after thaw; till, in his rage<br/>
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea<br/>
Swallows him with his host, but them lets pass,<br/>
As on dry land, between two crystal walls,<br/>
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand<br/>
Divided till his rescued gain their shore:<br/>
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,<br/>
Though present in his Angel, who shall go<br/>
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire—<br/>
By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire—<br/>
To guide them in their journey, and remove<br/>
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues.<br/>
All night he will pursue, but his approach<br/>
Darkness defends between till morning-watch;<br/>
Then through the fiery pillar and the cloud<br/>
God looking forth will trouble all his host,<br/>
And craze their chariot-wheels: when, by command,<br/>
Moses once more his potent rod extends<br/>
Over the sea; the sea his rod obeys;<br/>
On their imbattled ranks the waves return,<br/>
And overwhelm their war. The race elect<br/>
Safe towards Canaan, from the shore, advance<br/>
Through the wild Desert-not the readiest way,<br/>
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,<br/>
War terrify them inexpert, and fear<br/>
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather<br/>
Inglorious life with servitude; for life<br/>
To noble and ignoble is more sweet<br/>
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.<br/>
This also shall they gain by their delay<br/>
In the wide wilderness: there they shall found<br/>
Their government, and their great Senate choose<br/>
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by laws ordained.<br/>
God, from the Mount of Sinai, whose grey top<br/>
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself,<br/>
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpet's sound,<br/>
Ordain them laws-part, such as appertain<br/>
To civil justice; part, religious rites<br/>
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types<br/>
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise<br/>
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve<br/>
Mankind's deliverance. But the voice of God<br/>
To mortal ear is dreadful: they beseech<br/>
That Moses might report to them his will,<br/>
And terror cease; he grants what they besought,<br/>
Instructed that to God is no access<br/>
Without Mediator, whose high office now<br/>
Moses in figure bears, to introduce<br/>
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,<br/>
And all the Prophets, in their age, the times<br/>
Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus laws and rites<br/>
Established, such delight hath God in men<br/>
Obedient to his will that he voutsafes<br/>
Among them to set up his Tabernacle—<br/>
The Holy One with mortal men to dwell.<br/>
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed<br/>
Of cedar, overlaid with gold; therein<br/>
An ark, and in the Ark his testimony,<br/>
The records of his covenant; over these<br/>
A mercy-seat of gold, between the wings<br/>
Of two bright Cherubim; before him burn<br/>
Seven lamps, as in a zodiac representing<br/>
The heavenly fires. Over the tent a cloud<br/>
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night,<br/>
Save when they journey; and at length they come,<br/>
Conducted by his Angel, to the land<br/>
Promised to Abraham and his seed. The rest<br/>
Were long to tell-how many battles fought;<br/>
How many kings destroyed, and kingdoms won;<br/>
Or how the sun shall in mid-heaven stand still<br/>
A day entire, and night's due course adjourn,<br/>
Man's voice commanding, 'Sun, in Gibeon stand,<br/>
And thou, Moon, in the vale of Aialon,<br/>
Till Israel overcome!'-so call the third<br/>
From Abraham, son of Isaac, and from him<br/>
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win."

Here Adam interposed:—"O sent from Heaven,<br/>
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things<br/>
Thou hast revealed, those chiefly which concern<br/>
Just Abraham and his seed. Now first I find<br/>
Mine eyes true opening, and my heart much eased,<br/>
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become<br/>
Of me and all mankind; but now I see<br/>
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest—<br/>
Favour unmerited by me, who sought<br/>
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.<br/>
This yet I apprehend not-why to those<br/>
Among whom God will deign to dwell on Earth<br/>
So many and so various laws are given.<br/>
So many laws argue so many sins<br/>
Among them; how can God with such reside?"

To whom thus Michael:—"Doubt not but that sin<br/>
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br/>
And therefore was law given them, to evince<br/>
Their natural pravity, by stirring up<br/>
Sin against Law to fight, that, when they see<br/>
Law can discover sin, but no remove,<br/>
Save by those shadowy expiations weak,<br/>
The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude<br/>
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man,<br/>
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness,<br/>
To them by faith imputed, they may find<br/>
Justification towards God, and peace<br/>
Of conscience, which the law by ceremonies<br/>
Cannot appease, nor man the moral part<br/>
Perform, and not performing cannot live.<br/>
So Law appears imperfect, and but given<br/>
With purpose to resign them, in full time,<br/>
Up to a better covenant, disciplined<br/>
From shadowy types to truth, from flesh to spirit,<br/>
From imposition of strict laws to free<br/>
Acceptance of large grace, from servile fear<br/>
To filial, works of law to works of faith.<br/>
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God<br/>
Highly beloved, being but the minister<br/>
Of Law, his people into Canaan lead;<br/>
But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,<br/>
His name and office bearing who shall quell<br/>
The adversary Serpent, and bring back<br/>
Through the world's wilderness long-wandered Man<br/>
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.<br/>
Meanwhile they, in their earthly Canaan placed,<br/>
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins<br/>
National interrupt their public peace,<br/>
Provoking God to raise them enemies—<br/>
From whom as oft he saves them penitent,<br/>
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom<br/>
The second, both for piety renowned<br/>
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive<br/>
Irrevocable, that his regal throne<br/>
For ever shall endure. The like shall sing<br/>
All Prophecy-that of the royal stock<br/>
Of David (so I name this king) shall rise<br/>
A son, the Woman's Seed to thee foretold,<br/>
Foretold to Abraham as in whom shall trust<br/>
All nations, and to kings foretold of kings<br/>
The last, for of his reign shall be no end.<br/>
But first a long succession must ensue;<br/>
And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,<br/>
The clouded Ark of God, till then in tents<br/>
Wandering, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.<br/>
Such follow him as shall be registered<br/>
Part good, part bad; of bad the longer scroll:<br/>
Whose foul idolatries and other faults,<br/>
Heaped to the popular sum, will so incense<br/>
God, as to leave them, and expose their land,<br/>
Their city, his Temple, and his holy Ark,<br/>
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey<br/>
To that proud city whose high walls thou saw'st<br/>
Left in confusion, Babylon thence called.<br/>
There in captivity he lets them dwell<br/>
The space of seventy years; then brings them back,<br/>
Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn<br/>
To David, established as the days of Heaven.<br/>
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings,<br/>
Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God<br/>
They first re-edify, and for a while<br/>
In mean estate live moderate, till, grown<br/>
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow.<br/>
But first among the priests dissension springs—<br/>
Men who attend the altar, and should most<br/>
Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings<br/>
Upon the Temple itself; at last they seize<br/>
The sceptre, and regard not David's sons;<br/>
Then lose it to a stranger, that the true<br/>
Anointed King Messiah might be born<br/>
Barred of his right. Yet at his birth a Star,<br/>
Unseen before in heaven, proclaims him come,<br/>
And guides the eastern sages, who inquire<br/>
His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold:<br/>
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br/>
To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br/>
They gladly thither haste, and by a quire<br/>
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.<br/>
A Virgin is his mother, but his sire<br/>
The Power of the Most High. He shall ascend<br/>
The throne hereditary, and bound his reign<br/>
With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens."

He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy<br/>
Surcharged as had, like grief, been dewed in tears,<br/>
Without the vent of words; which these he breathed:—

"O prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br/>
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand<br/>
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain—<br/>
Why our great Expectation should be called<br/>
The Seed of Woman. Virgin Mother, hail!<br/>
High in the love of Heaven, yet from my loins<br/>
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy womb the Son<br/>
Of God Most High; so God with Man unites.<br/>
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise<br/>
Except with mortal pain. Say where and when<br/>
Their fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victor's heel."

To whom thus Michael:—"Dream not of their fight<br/>
As of a duel, or the local wounds<br/>
Of head or heel. Not therefore joins the Son<br/>
Manhood to Godhead, with more strength to foil<br/>
Thy enemy; nor so is overcome<br/>
Satan, whose fall from Heaven, a deadlier bruise,<br/>
Disabled not to give thee thy death's wound;<br/>
Which he who comes thy Saviour shall recure,<br/>
Not by destroying Satan, but his works<br/>
In thee and in thy seed. Nor can this be,<br/>
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,<br/>
Obedience to the law of God, imposed<br/>
On penalty of death, and suffering death,<br/>
The penalty to thy transgression due,<br/>
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:<br/>
So only can high justice rest appaid.<br/>
The Law of God exact he shall fulfil<br/>
Both by obedience and by love, though love<br/>
Alone fulfil the Law; thy punishment<br/>
He shall endure, by coming in the flesh<br/>
To a reproachful life and cursed death,<br/>
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe<br/>
In his redemption, and that his obedience<br/>
Imputed becomes theirs by faith-his merits<br/>
To save them, not their own, though legal, works.<br/>
For this he shall live hated, be blasphemed,<br/>
Seized on by force, judged, and to death condemned<br/>
A shameful and accursed, nailed to the Cross<br/>
By his own nation, slain for bringing life;<br/>
But to the cross he nails thy enemies—<br/>
The Law that is against thee, and the sins<br/>
Of all mankind, with him there crucified,<br/>
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust<br/>
In this his satisfaction. So he dies,<br/>
But soon revives; Death over him no power<br/>
Shall long usurp. Ere the third dawning light<br/>
Return, the stars of morn shall see him rise<br/>
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,<br/>
Thy ransom paid, which Man from Death redeems—<br/>
His death for Man, as many as offered life<br/>
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace<br/>
By faith not void of works. This godlike act<br/>
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have died,<br/>
In sin for ever lost from life; this act<br/>
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,<br/>
Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms,<br/>
And fix far deeper in his head their stings<br/>
Than temporal death shall bruise the Victor's heel,<br/>
Or theirs whom he redeems-a death like sleep,<br/>
A gentle wafting to immortal life.<br/>
Nor after resurrection shall he stay<br/>
Longer on Earth than certain times to appear<br/>
To his disciples-men who in his life<br/>
Still followed him; to them shall leave in charge<br/>
To teach all nations what of him they learned<br/>
And his salvation, them who shall believe<br/>
Baptizing in the profluent stream-the sign<br/>
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life<br/>
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,<br/>
For death like that which the Redeemer died.<br/>
All nations they shall teach; for from that day<br/>
Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins<br/>
Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons<br/>
Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world;<br/>
So in his seed all nations shall be blest.<br/>
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend<br/>
With victory, triumphing through the air<br/>
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise<br/>
The Serpent, Prince of Air, and drag in chains<br/>
Through all his realm, and there confounded leave;<br/>
Then enter into glory and resume<br/>
His seat at God's right hand, exalted high<br/>
Above all names in Heaven; and thence shall come,<br/>
When this World's dissolution shall be ripe,<br/>
With glory and power, to judge both quick and dead—<br/>
To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward<br/>
His faithful, and receive them into bliss,<br/>
Whether in Heaven or Earth; for then the Earth<br/>
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place<br/>
Than this of Eden, and far happier days."

So spake the Archangel Michael; then paused,<br/>
As at the World's great period; and our Sire,<br/>
Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied:—

"O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense,<br/>
That all this good of evil shall produce,<br/>
And evil turn to good-more wonderful<br/>
Than that which by creation first brought forth<br/>
Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,<br/>
Whether I should repent me now of sin<br/>
By me done and occasioned, or rejoice<br/>
Much more that much more good thereof shall spring—<br/>
To God more glory, more good-will to men<br/>
From God-and over wrauth grace shall abound.<br/>
But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven<br/>
Must reascend, what will betide the few,<br/>
His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,<br/>
The enemies of truth. Who then shall guide<br/>
His people, who defend? Will they not deal<br/>
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?"

"Be sure they will," said the Angel; "but from Heaven<br/>
He to his own a Comforter will send,<br/>
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell,<br/>
His Spirit, within them, and the law of faith<br/>
Working through love upon their hearts shall write,<br/>
To guide them in all truth, and also arm<br/>
With spiritual armour, able to resist<br/>
Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts—<br/>
What man can do against them not afraid,<br/>
Though to the death; against such cruelties<br/>
With inward consolations recompensed,<br/>
And often supported so as shall amaze<br/>
Their proudest persecutors. For the Spirit,<br/>
Poured first on his Apostles, whom he sends<br/>
To evangelize the nations, then on all<br/>
Baptized, shall them with wondrous gifts endue<br/>
To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,<br/>
As did their Lord before them. Thus they win<br/>
Great numbers of each nation to receive<br/>
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: at length,<br/>
Their ministry performed, and race well run,<br/>
Their doctrine and their story written left,<br/>
They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,<br/>
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,<br/>
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven<br/>
To their own vile advantages shall turn<br/>
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth<br/>
With superstitions and traditions taint,<br/>
Left only in those written Records pure,<br/>
Though not but by the Spirit understood.<br/>
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,<br/>
Palaces, and titles, and with these to join<br/>
Secular power, though feigning still to act<br/>
By spiritual; to themselves appropriating<br/>
The Spirit of God, promised alike and given<br/>
To all believers; and, from that pretense,<br/>
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force<br/>
On every conscience-laws which none shall find<br/>
Left them enrowled, or what the Spirit within<br/>
Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then<br/>
But force the Spirit of Grace itself, and bind<br/>
His consort, Liberty? what but unbuild<br/>
His living temples, built by faith to stand—<br/>
Their own faith, not another's? for, on Earth,<br/>
Who against faith and conscience can be heard<br/>
Infallible? Yet many will presume:<br/>
Whence heavy persecution shall arise<br/>
On all who in the worship persevere<br/>
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, far greater part,<br/>
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms<br/>
Religion satisfied; Truth shall retire<br/>
Bestuck with slanderous darts, and works of Faith<br/>
Rarely be found. So shall the World go on,<br/>
To good malignant, to bad men benign,<br/>
Under her own weight groaning, till the day<br/>
Appear of respiration to the just<br/>
And vengeance to the wicked, at return<br/>
Of Him so lately promised to thy aid,<br/>
The Woman's Seed-obscurely then foretold,<br/>
Now amplier known the Saviour and thy Lord;<br/>
Last in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed<br/>
In glory of the Father, to dissolve<br/>
Satan with his perverted World; then raise<br/>
From the conflagrant mass, purged and refined,<br/>
New Heavens, new Earth, Ages of endless date<br/>
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,<br/>
To bring forth fruits, joy and eternal bliss."

He ended; and thus Adam last replied:—<br/>
"How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,<br/>
Measured this transient World, the race of Time,<br/>
Till Time stand fixed! Beyond is all abyss—<br/>
Eternity, whose end no eye can reach.<br/>
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,<br/>
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill<br/>
Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;<br/>
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.<br/>
Henceforth I learn that to obey is best,<br/>
And love with fear the only God, to walk<br/>
As in his presence, ever to observe<br/>
His providence, and on him sole depend,<br/>
Merciful over all his works, with good<br/>
Still overcoming evil, and by small<br/>
Accomplishing great things-by things deemed weak<br/>
Subverting worldly-strong, and worldly-wise<br/>
By simply meek; that suffering for Truth's sake<br/>
Is fortitude to highest victory,<br/>
And to the faithful death the gate of life—<br/>
Taught this by his example whom I now<br/>
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest."

To whom thus also the Angel last replied:—<br/>
"This having learned, thou hast attained the sum<br/>
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the stars<br/>
Thou knew'st by name, and all the ethereal powers,<br/>
All secrets of the Deep, all Nature's works,<br/>
Or works of God in heaven, air, earth, or sea,<br/>
And all the riches of this world enjoy'dst,<br/>
And all the rule, one empire. Only add<br/>
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable; add faith;<br/>
Add virtue, patience, temperance; add love,<br/>
By name to come called Charity, the soul<br/>
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth<br/>
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess<br/>
A Paradise within thee, happier far.<br/>
Let us descend now, therefore, from this top<br/>
Of speculation; for the hour precise<br/>
Exacts our parting hence; and, see! the guards,<br/>
By me encamped on yonder hill, expect<br/>
Their motion, at whose front a flaming sword,<br/>
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round.<br/>
We may no longer stay. Go, waken Eve;<br/>
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed,<br/>
Portending good, and all her spirits composed<br/>
To meek submission: thou, at season fit,<br/>
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard—<br/>
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,<br/>
The great deliverance by her seed to come<br/>
(For by the Woman's Seed) on all mankind—<br/>
That ye may live, which will be many days,<br/>
Both in one faith unanimous; though sad<br/>
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheered<br/>
With meditation on the happy end."

He ended, and they both descend the hill.<br/>
Descended, Adam to the bower where Eve<br/>
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her waked;<br/>
And thus with words not sad she him received:—

"Whence thou return'st and whither went'st I know;<br/>
For God is also in sleep, and dreams advise,<br/>
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br/>
Presaging, since, with sorrow and heart's distress<br/>
Wearied, I fell asleep. But now lead on;<br/>
In me is no delay; with thee to go<br/>
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay<br/>
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to me<br/>
Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,<br/>
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.<br/>
This further consolation yet secure<br/>
I carry hence: though all by me is lost,<br/>
Such favour I unworthy am voutsafed,<br/>
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore."

So spake our mother Eve; and Adam heard<br/>
Well pleased, by answered not; for now too nigh<br/>
The Archangel stood, and from the other hill<br/>
To their fixed station, all in bright array,<br/>
The Cherubim descended, on the ground<br/>
Gliding meteorous, as evening mist<br/>
Risen from a river o'er the marish glides,<br/>
And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel<br/>
Homeward returning. High in front advanced,<br/>
The brandished sword of God before them blazed,<br/>
Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,<br/>
And vapour at the Libyan air adust,<br/>
Began to parch that temperate clime; whereat<br/>
In either hand the hastening Angel caught<br/>
Our lingering Parents, and to the eastern gate<br/>
Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast<br/>
To the subjected plain-then disappeared.<br/>
They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld<br/>
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,<br/>
Waved over by that flaming brand; the gate<br/>
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms.<br/>
Some natural tears they dropped, but wiped them soon;<br/>
The world was all before them, where to choose<br/>
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide.<br/>
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,<br/>
Through Eden took their solitarie way.<br/>
